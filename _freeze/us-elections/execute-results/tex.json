This includes data on elections to the U.S. House of Representatives, at the constituency level [@elections_data]. The data is regularly updated, and a version of this dataset containing information about elections from 1976 to 2022 was used as a [TidyTuesday dataset in November 2023](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2023/2023-11-07). We can again load the data in using the `tt_load()` function from {tidytuesdayR}: \\index{TidyTuesday} \\index{tidytuesdayR!tt\\_load}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2023-11-07\")\nhouse <- tuesdata$house\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 32452 rows and 20 columns in the data. Let's take a look at the first few rows of the data using `head()` (or `View()` if you prefer): \\index{utils!head}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(house)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 x 20\n   year state  state_po state_fips state_cen state_ic office\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl> <chr> \n1  1976 ALABA~ AL                1        63       41 US HO~\n2  1976 ALABA~ AL                1        63       41 US HO~\n3  1976 ALABA~ AL                1        63       41 US HO~\n4  1976 ALABA~ AL                1        63       41 US HO~\n5  1976 ALABA~ AL                1        63       41 US HO~\n6  1976 ALABA~ AL                1        63       41 US HO~\n# i 13 more variables: district <chr>, stage <chr>,\n#   runoff <lgl>, special <lgl>, candidate <chr>,\n#   party <chr>, writein <lgl>, mode <chr>,\n#   candidatevotes <dbl>, totalvotes <dbl>,\n#   unofficial <lgl>, version <dbl>, fusion_ticket <lgl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many `state` columns, essentially providing similar information in different formats e.g. the `state` column provides the state name and the `state_po` column provides the state two-letter abbreviation. There is also a column to identify the constituency (district) within the state. The data gives information about candidates: their name, their political party affiliation, and how many votes they received in the elections they stood in. Other columns provide information about the election, including total number of votes cast, the electoral stage, whether it was a special election, and whether it was a runoff election. The `version` column contains a data which identifies which release version of the data it is.\n\n## Exploratory work\n\nThe `house` data is very granular, and it's unlikely we'll be able to visualize all of the information in one chart. Therefore we can think about different ways of subsetting or aggregating the data. We might choose to focus on:\n\n* State: Voting patterns within a specific state, or aggregating to look at state-level data instead of constituency-level\n\n* Party: We have information on which party each candidate stood for in the election, including data on fusion tickets where candidates stand for multiple parties.\n\n* Time: Data is provided from 1976 to 2022, and we might want to look at trends in vote share or vote counts over time.\n\n### Data exploration\n\nLet's start by having a quick look at whether or not the number of votes has changed over time. The data goes back to 1976 and the population of the USA has increased by over 150% between the 1970 and 2020 censuses [@UScensuspop] so might we also expect a similar increase in votes? Let's start by having a look at the number of candidate votes over time with a quick scatter plot made with `plot()`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(\n  x = house$year,\n  y = house$candidatevotes,\n  xlab = \"\",\n  ylab = \"Number of candidate votes\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot showing the number of candidate votes over time, where it's clear that elections take place every two years and there has been little change over time.](us-elections_files/figure-pdf/fig-elections-scatterplot-1.pdf){#fig-elections-scatterplot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere doesn't seem to be an especially interesting pattern in votes over time, at least at first glance, in @fig-elections-scatterplot. However, it has highlighted a potential data issue. In most years, the highest values are around 300,000 but there are two observations in 2022 where the values are well over 1,000,000. We had a similar issue in @sec-bees, where some observations were the sum of other observations. This doesn't seem to be the case here. For now, let's exclude these and look at data where the number of candidate votes is below 600,000.\n\nWe might also be interested in how the number of candidate votes varies by party, and we can use the `boxplot()` function to take a explore whether or not there are big differences: \\index{graphics!boxplot}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(\n  candidatevotes ~ party,\n  data = house[house$candidatevotes < 600000, ],\n  horizontal = TRUE,\n  las = 1,\n  xlab = \"Number of candidate votes\",\n  ylab = NULL\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Box plot showing the number of candidate votes for each party, with many party labels being hidden due to the large number of unique parties (with small numbers of votes).](us-elections_files/figure-pdf/fig-elections-boxplot-1.pdf){#fig-elections-boxplot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn @fig-elections-boxplot there are a couple of interesting points to note. First, there are many, many unique `party` names because every independent candidate is listed as a different party name. This means that not all party names can actually by read off from the chart. Secondly, there are a lot of outliers shown in the data, which is highly skewed. Finally, there are a couple of parties that have a much higher numbers of votes. Inspecting the data confirms that these are, as we might guess, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.\n\n### Exploratory sketches\n\nThe Democratic and Republican parties have dominated elections during this time period. It's unlikely we'd be able to draw any reliable insights about individual independent candidates because the numbers are so small, so let's group all other party candidates together into an *other* category. We can look at combining @fig-elections-scatterplot and @fig-elections-boxplot, alongside information about each state to look at whether there are changing patterns in vote share for the major parties over time and space. \n\nWe might consider creating an area chart faceted by stated showing the percentage of votes for the Democratic party, the Republican party, and other parties. States that are geographically close together may be more likely to exhibit similar patterns. Rather than arranging the faceted area charts in a rectangular grid, it would make more sense to arrange them based on their geographic location. This would enable easier comparison of patterns across states. @fig-elections-sketch shows an example of what this might look like:\n\n![Initial sketch of a faceted area chart arranged in a grid shaped like the United States.](images/sketch-elections.png){#fig-elections-sketch fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"\"}\n\nOften in facet charts, the x- and y- axes are shown multiple times. This can often make a chart, especially when using a geographic layout like this, look overly *busy*. We might choose to create a very minimalist set of facet charts, and use colored text as a legend, as we did in @sec-turbines and @sec-lemurs. Though the minimalist approach may look cleaner, it can also mean that it's not as clear what's being shown on a chart. Let's add a *how to read this chart* explainer as a legend, created from a zoomed in version of one of the facet plots:\n\n![Initial sketch of a faceted area chart arranged in a grid shaped like the United States. An enlarged version of one area chart is used as a legend on the left hand side.](images/sketch-elections-2.png){#fig-elections-sketch-2 fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"\"}\n\n## Preparing a plot\n\nIn order to bring @fig-elections-sketch-2 to life, we need to start by aggregating the *other* parties, and calculating the number of votes per party, year, and state.\n\n### Data wrangling\n\nTo aggregate the *other* parties, we use `mutate()` from {dplyr} to update the existing `party` column. We create the new party categories using `case_when()` and also take the opportunity to provide slightly better, alternative labels for the two dominant parties. \\index{dplyr!mutate} \\index{dplyr!case\\_when}\n\nThe `stage` column contains information on whether the election was a general election (`\"GEN\"`) or primary election (`\"PRI\"`). To keep things simpler, we use `filter()` from {dplyr} to restrict the data to general elections only. We then use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to add up the number of votes in each year, state, and party category - remembering to `ungroup()` the data at the end! \\index{dplyr!filter} \\index{dplyr!group\\_by} \\index{dplyr!summarise} \\index{dplyr!ungroup}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhouse_data <- house |>\n  dplyr::mutate(party = dplyr::case_when(\n    party == \"REPUBLICAN\" ~ \"Republican Party\",\n    party == \"DEMOCRAT\" ~ \"Democratic Party\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n  )) |>\n  dplyr::filter(stage == \"GEN\") |>\n  dplyr::group_by(year, state_po, party) |>\n  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(candidatevotes)) |>\n  dplyr::ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some years for which there were no `\"Other\"` candidates in some states, and so there are no rows for these values i.e. they are implicitly missing. As we saw in @sec-r-pkgs, this can cause misleading area charts and results in a warning from {ggplot2}. As in @sec-r-pkgs, these *missing* values are not actually missing, they are simply 0. We'll do as we did before and make sure that every combination of `year`, `state_po`, and `party` exists in the data by using `complete()` from {tidyr}, and setting any *missing* combinations explicitly to 0. \\index{tidyr!complete}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- house_data |>\n  tidyr::complete(\n    year, state_po, party,\n    fill = list(votes = 0)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### The first plot\n\nWe're once again going to create a faceted plot, as we did in @sec-programming, @sec-museums, and @sec-technology. There are two key differences with this plot:\n\n* Instead of arranging the plots into a rectangular shape with a specified number of rows and columns, we want to arrange the plots in a way that resembles some underlying geography.\n* There are far more facets (over 50) compared to the previous plots we've made (which have mostly had less than 10). Sometimes creating a large number of facets can be slow.\n\nIt's this second issue that means when developing faceted plots, especially when using large data or a complex visualization, it can be useful to create a single plot first. That is, filter the data and create a chart for just one level of the faceting category. This allows you to get the basics of your chart correct, before you start worrying about facet layout.\n\nWe start by passing in our `plot_data` to to the `data` argument of `ggplot()`, wrapped inside the `filter()` function from {dplyr} which subsets the data to just California. We set up the aesthetic mapping to plot the year on the x-axis and the number of votes on the y-axis, split by party. \\index{dplyr!filter} \\index{ggplot2!ggplot} \\index{ggplot2!aes}\n\nWe've already seen examples of making area charts in @sec-museums and @sec-r-pkgs, but we're going to make a slight change in this chapter. Since we're going to be comparing states (which each have very different population sizes, and therefore will have very different numbers of votes), rather than considering an area chart of number of votes, we'll look at the proportion for each party. Luckily, we don't have to calculate these percentages ourselves, since setting `position = \"fill\"` inside `geom_area()` does this for us. \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_area}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nbasic_plot <- ggplot(\n  data = dplyr::filter(plot_data, state_po == \"CA\")\n) +\n  geom_area(\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = year, y = votes, fill = party\n    ),\n    position = \"fill\"\n  )\nbasic_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Area chart showing the percentage of votes for different political party categories for California. The default colors, styling, and legend have been applied.](us-elections_files/figure-pdf/fig-elections-single-plot-1.pdf){#fig-elections-single-plot fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a basic plot for one of the facet values.\n\n::: {#tip-elections-piping .callout-tip}\n\n## Piping data into `ggplot()`\n\nSince the first argument of `ggplot` is `data`, this means that we *could* pipe the data into the `ggplot()` function rather than explicitly stating it as the first argument. For example, the code above could be re-written as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data |>\n  dplyr::filter(state_po == \"CA\") |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_area(\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = year, y = votes, fill = party\n    ),\n    position = \"fill\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough this may arguably look neater than nesting `filter()` inside `ggplot()`, you're unlikely to see any other examples of piping into `ggplot()` for two reasons:\n\n* The combination of `+` and `|>` looks odd, and this outweighs the increased neatness from piping (personal opinion).\n* It makes it easier to end up with very long, complicated code. Keeping the data wrangling and the plotting code separate often makes more sense.\n\n:::\n\nWe can now pass the full data into `ggplot()` (rather than just the California subset) and add `facet_wrap()` to create an area chart for each value in `state_po`. \\index{ggplot2!ggplot} \\index{ggplot2!aes} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_area} \\index{ggplot2!facet\\_wrap}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='2,11'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbasic_plot <- ggplot(\n  data = plot_data\n) +\n  geom_area(\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = year, y = votes, fill = party\n    ),\n    position = \"fill\"\n  )\nbasic_plot +\n  facet_wrap(~state_po)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Faceted area chart arranged in a rectangular grid shaped, showing percentage of votes per party over time. The area charts cannot be seen due to the size of the facet labels.](us-elections_files/figure-pdf/fig-elections-basic-plot-1.pdf){#fig-elections-basic-plot fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn @fig-elections-basic-plot, we can't actually see any of our area charts, only the facet labels. This is a very common problem when working with large numbers of facet categories, and smaller chart sizes. We'll deal with this problem a little bit later when adjusting the plot themes. \n\n### Faceting with {geofacet}\n\nTo arrange the faceted plots into a grid that resembles the underlying geography, we'll use the {geofacet} package [@geofacet]. The {geofacet} package makes it easier to arrange facets in the shape of a map. This makes it easier to compare data across regions, like states or countries, in a grid format. There are many built-in grids for different geographical regions, including the several for the United States of America. However, you can also create your own custom facet grid if you prefer a different layout, or if no grid exists for the region you are plotting.\n\nTo do faceting with {geofacet}, we use `facet_geo()` instead of `facet_wrap()`. It works in essentially the same way, and we start by using a `~` to indicate which column is the faceting column. However, there are two things that are a little bit different: \\index{geofacet!facet\\_geo} \\index{geofacet!facet\\_geo}\n\n* We need to specify which grid layout we want to use. You can use the `get_grid_names()` function in {geofacet} to get a list of all of the valid grid names. They are named sensibly based on what region the grid is for e.g. `\"us_state_grid1\"` and `\"eu_grid1\"`. Here, we'll use `\"us_state_grid2\"`. \n\n* In order to map the data to the correct facet position on the grid, one of the columns in the data must align with the value in the `code` column of your chosen grid. In the `\"us_state_grid2\"` grid, the `code` column contains the two letter state abbreviations which matches the `state_po` column in our data. If you didn't have the two letter abbreviations, you may need to do so data joining to attach them.\n\nIf you have additional *states* (e.g. Puerto Rico can sometimes be listed in a US state column even though it isn't) or are missing some states, you can still use `geo_facet()`. However, it will only plot states listed in the facet grid, and you may get a warning message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(geofacet)\nmap_plot <- basic_plot +\n  geofacet::facet_geo(\n    ~state_po,\n    grid = \"us_state_grid2\"\n  )\nmap_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Faceted area chart arranged in a grid shaped like the United States, showing percentage of votes per party over time. The area charts cannot be seen due to the size of the facet labels.](us-elections_files/figure-pdf/fig-elections-geofacet-plot-1.pdf){#fig-elections-geofacet-plot fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe still have the same problem of not being able to see the details of the chart as there are so many, but you can see from just the facet titles, that the plots are now arranged in a grid that resembles the USA. \n\n## Advanced styling\n\nWe'll now style our charts to apply more intuitive colors, adjust the facet labels to allow the charts to be seen more easily, and create a custom legend that explains how to read this chart.\n\n### Colors\n\nIn the USA, the Republican Party is represented by the color red and the Democratic Party by blue. As we discussed in @sec-lemurs, when choosing which colors to use for well-known categories, it's important not to play into negative stereotypes (e.g. pink for girls). But it's also important to use what is intuitive. Since these are colors that the parties have chosen to represent themselves, and because they are so well recognized, we'll stick to red and blue. \n\nSince the visualization is already quite busy, we keep the background colors very simple - using only black and white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nblue_col <- \"#0015BC\"\nred_col <- \"#C41E3A\"\nother_col <- \"#AAAAAA\"\ntext_col <- \"black\"\nbg_col <- \"white\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then apply the colors to our plot using `scale_fill_manual()`, and assigning each color to the relevant party label in `values`. Since we know we're going to be creating our own legend later, we'll remove the default legend by setting `guide = \"none\"`. \\index{ggplot2!scale\\_fill\\_manual}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol_plot <- map_plot +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Democratic Party\" = blue_col,\n      \"Republican Party\" = red_col,\n      \"Other\" = other_col\n    ),\n    guide = \"none\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Text and fonts\n\nAs in previous chapters, fonts can be defined using the {sysfonts} and {showtext} packages. For the main font, we'll use the *Roboto* font as we did in @sec-doctors. For the title text, we'll use *Carter One*, a [display font designed by Vernon Adams](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Carter+One) inspired by fonts used in mid 20th century advertising. It's a bold font which works well for titles of visualizations. \\index{sysfonts!font\\_add\\_google} \\index{showtext!showtext\\_auto} \\index{showtext!showtext\\_opts}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsysfonts::font_add_google(name = \"Roboto\")\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\n  name = \"Carter One\", family = \"Carter\"\n)\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\nshowtext::showtext_opts(dpi = 300)\nbody_font <- \"Roboto\"\ntitle_font <- \"Carter\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe write text for the subtitle, using `glue()` to add HTML styling for colored text as we did in @sec-cats and @sec-lemurs. The colored text serves as a legend (though we'll later also add our own custom legend in addition), and the subtitle text provides information about what the chart shows. As in @sec-time-zones, we'll add the information about the source of the data on a new line at the end of subtitle, rather than in the caption. We also add the title text directly in the subtitle variable to enable easier placement of the text, again as we did in @sec-time-zones. \\index{glue!glue}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nst <- glue::glue(\"<span style='font-size:10pt; font-family:{title_font}; color:{text_col};'>Votes in US House Elections</span><br>Area charts indicate the percentage of votes for the <span style='color:{blue_col};'>Democratic Party</span>, the <span style='color:{red_col};'>Republican Party</span>, and <span style='color:#aaaaaa;'>Other</span> parties in general elections between 1976 and 2022.<br><br>**Data**: U.S. House 1976–2022. MIT Election Data and Science Lab.\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also define our `social_caption()` using the function we defined in @sec-cats, which we'll later add as a plot caption: \\index{social\\_caption}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsocial <- social_caption(\n  icon_color = blue_col,\n  font_color = text_col,\n  font_family = body_font\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then pass our subtitle, and caption text into the `labs()` function to add it to our plot. Since we want to position the subtitle text in an unusual place, we use the `tag` argument rather than `subtitle`, similar to what we did in @sec-time-zones. \\index{ggplot2!labs} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntext_plot <- col_plot +\n  labs(\n    tag = st,\n    caption = social\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Adjusting themes\n\nWe know that the facet labels are too large on are currently dominating the visualization as seen in @fig-elections-geofacet-plot. There are a few solutions to this:\n\n* Make the facet labels much smaller. However, this can make them hard to read and renders the labels somewhat pointless.\n\n* Increase the size of the chart. Here, we're constrained by the physical width of the plot and can't make it wider. Though we could make the plot taller, we're then adding quite a lot of additional space simply for labels. \n\n* Create our own custom facet labels. \n\nHere, we're going to go for the third option. Later, we'll use the `theme()` function to remove the default facet labels. For now, let's think about what labels to add. To save space in the plot, the easiest way is to use inset facet labels - positioning the state label inside the area chart. This has the downside of hiding part of the data. However, we can make the text semi-transparent to allow both the state label and the area chart behind to be seen.\n\nWe add text labels with `geom_text()`. The x-coordinate position of the text is set as the mean of the years in the full `plot_data` data to automatically position it in the middle of the chart. The y-coordinate position is set to `0.5` i.e. also in the middle of the chart since the `position = \"fill\"` argument scales the y-axis to be between `0` and `1`. The `alpha()` function is used to control the transparency of the text color. \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_text}  \\index{ggplot2!aes} \\index{ggplot2!alpha}\n\nNote that we use a much smaller value of in `alpha()` than we normally would here. This is because there are actually multiple labels drawn on top of each other - one for each year, and party combination. Though this isn't necessarily a problem, if we're trying to create semi-transparent labels, stacking many copies of the same semi-transparent label on top of each other, results in a pretty opaque label. Though we could filtering the data to consider only one year and party, the {geofacet} package sometimes has issues rendering the labels correctly with this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstyled_plot_1 <- text_plot +\n  geom_text(\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = mean(range(plot_data$year)),\n      y = 0.5,\n      label = state_po\n    ),\n    family = title_font,\n    color = alpha(bg_col, 0.02),\n    size = 2.5\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we've done in previous chapters we set `expand = FALSE` inside `coord_cartesian()` to remove the additional space around each plot panel. We also use `theme_void()` to remove any additional plot elements since we're aiming for a minimal look and we'll later design a custom legend that gives the reader all the information that would normally be conveyed by the axes labels and title. \\index{ggplot2!theme\\_void} \\index{ggplot2!coord\\_cartesian}\n\nAs in previous chapters we use the `element_rect()` function to set `plot.background` to our pre-defined background color variable. We also adjust the plot margins using `plot.margin`. Note that here we're making the left plot margin very large, as this is where we'll later position our custom legend. We discussed pros and cons of this approach in @sec-lemurs. \\index{ggplot2!theme} \\index{ggplot2!element\\_rect} \\index{ggplot2!margin} \\index{ggplot2!unit} \\index{ggplot2!rel}\n\nWe can position the title text to the left of the plot, in the wide margin by choosing negative values for `hjust`. Remember the `0` means left-aligned and `1` means right-aligned. Negative values essentially mean *very left aligned*! This works here because the title is a single line of text, but for multi-line text the text alignment can often look odd. That means that for the subtitle text (which is a short paragraph), we're using `tag` instead of `subtitle` text. The `plot.tag.position` allows us to specify a vectpr of co-ordinates for where we want the text to appear - with negative x-coordinates also placing the text into the widened plot margin. It takes a little bit of trial and error to ensure that the `title` and `tag` text are aligned with each otehr. We again use `element_textbox_simple()` to enable automatic text wrapping for the plot `tag` text, and for the caption to make the icons render correctly. \\index{ggtext!element\\_textbox\\_simple}\n\nWe set both the `strip.background` and `strip.text` arguments to `element_blank()` to remove all default facet labels, and use `panel.spacing` to control the amount of space between the facets and move them closer together. \\index{ggplot2!element\\_blank} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstyled_plot_2 <- styled_plot_1 +\n  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_void(base_size = 6, base_family = body_font) +\n  theme(\n    # Background elements\n    plot.background = element_rect(\n      fill = bg_col,\n      color = bg_col\n    ),\n    plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 125),\n    plot.tag = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(\n      hjust = 0,\n      color = text_col,\n      maxwidth = 0.65,\n      lineheight = 0.6,\n      size = rel(1.0)\n    ),\n    plot.caption = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(\n      hjust = 1,\n      halign = 1,\n      color = text_col,\n      maxwidth = 0.65,\n      margin = margin(b = 0, t = 10)\n    ),\n    plot.tag.position = c(-0.50, 0.77),\n    # Facet arguments\n    strip.background = element_blank(),\n    strip.text = element_blank(),\n    panel.spacing = unit(0.05, \"lines\")\n  )\nstyled_plot_2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Faceted area chart arranged in a grid shaped like the United States, showing percentage of votes per party over time.

In @sec-time-zones, we used a bar chart as a legend which also served as another source of information in the visualization. In this chapter, our custom legend will instead serve as a *how to read this chart* explainer. \\index{legend}\n\nWe can take one of the facets, enlarge it, and add annotations to explain what data is shown on the chart. To keep the main chart looking clean, we don't currently have any axes titles or labels. For example, it's not immediately clear what years are covered by the data. This doesn't need added to every chart, but should be annotated on the legend. To increase the accessibility of the chart, and to make sure we don't rely on color alone as discussed in @sec-lemurs, we'll also add direct labels to identify the *Democratic Party* and *Republican Party* areas on the chart.\n\nLet's start by filtering the data, to select only a single state. It doesn't really matter which one we choose, although ideally one that has enough space for us to add the party labels directly on the chart. Here, we'll use California (`\"CA\"`) for the legend plot. \\index{dplyr!filter}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nca_data <- dplyr::filter(plot_data, state_po == \"CA\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then reuse the code written for the main plot, passing in the `ca_data` to the `ggplot()` function, then adding the aesthetic mapping and the area chart with `geom_area()`. The colors and custom state (facet) labels are added with `scale_fill_manual()` and `geom_text()` as discussed earlier in this chapter. \\index{ggplot2!ggplot} \\index{ggplot2!aes} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_area} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_text} \\index{ggplot2!scale\\_fill\\_manual}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nca_plot <- ggplot(data = ca_data) +\n  geom_area(\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = year,\n      y = votes,\n      fill = party\n    ),\n    position = \"fill\"\n  ) +\n  # label for state\n  geom_text(\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = mean(range(year)),\n      y = 0.5,\n      label = state_po\n    ),\n    family = title_font,\n    color = alpha(bg_col, 0.3),\n    size = 4\n  ) +\n  # colors\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Democratic Party\" = blue_col,\n      \"Republican Party\" = red_col,\n      \"Other\" = other_col\n    ),\n    guide = \"none\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then use the `annotate()` function to add: \\index{ggplot2!annotate} \\index{annotations}\n\n* Two labels for the start and end year of the data. To keep these within the bounds of the plot, we left align the start label on the left, and right align the end label on the right. \n\n* Two labels for the *Republican* and *Democratic* parties. We leave the *Other* category unlabeled as it's very small, and it's obviously the only category left over. \n\nAs in the main plot, we also set `expand = FALSE` inside `coord_cartesian()` to remove the additional space around the edges. We also use `theme_void()` to remove any additional chart elements, since the annotations convey all the necessary information. \\index{ggplot2!coord\\_cartesian} \\index{ggplot2!theme\\_void}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np_inset <- ca_plot +\n  # year labels\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = min(ca_data$year),\n    y = 0.05,\n    label = min(ca_data$year),\n    family = body_font,\n    color = bg_col,\n    size = 3,\n    hjust = 0\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = max(ca_data$year),\n    y = 0.05,\n    label = max(ca_data$year),\n    family = body_font,\n    color = bg_col,\n    size = 3,\n    hjust = 1\n  ) +\n  # Party labels\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = mean(range(ca_data$year)),\n    y = 0.8,\n    label = \"Democratic Party\",\n    family = body_font,\n    color = bg_col,\n    size = 3.5\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = mean(range(ca_data$year)),\n    y = 0.2,\n    label = \"Republican Party\",\n    family = body_font,\n    color = bg_col,\n    size = 3.5\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +\n  theme_void()\np_inset\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A custom legend plot consisting of a zoomed in version of the California facet with additional annotations indicating the time period and categories represented by different colors.](us-elections_files/figure-pdf/fig-elections-inset-plot-1.pdf){#fig-elections-inset-plot fig-align='center' fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur custom legend is now ready to add to @fig-elections-plot-style-2.\n\n### Joining with {patchwork}\n\nNow, the last step is to join together our custom legend with the main plot. We've already left some blank space on the main plot for the legend to go in, so we'll use the `inset_element()` function from {patchwork} [@patchwork] as we did in @sec-time-zones. We use the `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` arguments to choose where the corners of the legend appear in relation to the main plot -  getting these values correct takes some trial and error! Setting `align_to = \"full\"` allows us to choose the coordinates relative to the full chart area, rather than just the panel area as per the default settings. \\index{patchwork} \\index{patchwork!inset\\_element}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(patchwork)\nfinal_plot <- styled_plot_2 + inset_element(\n  p = p_inset,\n  left = 0.035,\n  bottom = 0.087,\n  right = 0.295,\n  top = 0.55,\n  align_to = \"full\"\n)\nfinal_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Faceted area chart arranged in a grid shaped like the United States, showing percentage of votes per party over time.

However, there are a few more improvements that could be made and other elements we may want to consider. \n\nThough use of state two-letter abbreviations saves space and avoids excessive text, it is more difficult for a reader to easily look up the state they are interested in - especially if they are less familiar with US geography. Perhaps adding some smaller text under the abbreviations, or creating an interactive version that provides state names upon hover, would make it easier. \n\nThe use of area charts to show percentages is intuitive and sensible for this, since vote share is essentially what decides an election. However, it would also be interesting to see the counts of the number of votes - especially since states can have vastly different populations. A small change in percentage for a state with a large population may result in large changes in number of votes, but this wouldn't be seen in our version of this visualization. \n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\nEach plot created during the process of developing the original version of this visualization was captured using {camcorder}, and is shown in the gif below.
