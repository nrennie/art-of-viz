The data can be downloaded from the Mapping Museums website at [www.mappingmuseums.org](www.mappingmuseums.org). It was also used as a \\#TidyTuesday\\index{TidyTuesday} [@tidytuesday] data set in November 2022, and we'll use that version for this chapter.\n\nLet's start by reading in the data and looking at the definitions of the variables: \\index{readr!read\\_csv}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmuseums <- readr::read_csv(\"data/museums.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe data contains information for 35 different variables on 4191 museums. After the first `museum_id` columns, the next 8 columns provide information on the location of the museum - including address and co-ordinates. The next set of columns provides information about the museums such as whether it's an accredited museum, how it's governed, what types of items it has, and when it was open. Since this is a collated data set, information is also provided on the original source of the data for some of these variables. The remaining columns provide information on the area in which the museum is located, including information about different deprivation indices and geodemogrqaphic group (type of area e.g. `\"University Towns and Cities\"`). A full glossary of the terms used can be found on the Mapping Museums website at [museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/glossary](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/glossary).\n\n## Exploratory work\n\nLet's start exploring what these variables look like!\n\n> Remember that you can use `View(museums)` to inspect the data in a more human-readable format.\n\n### Data exploration\n\nThere are many different aspects of this data we could inspect:\n\n* How are museums spread out across the UK? Is there a higher concentration of museums in more affluent areas?\n* What types of museums are most prevalent in the UK? Does the vary based on whether the museum is accredited?\n* How is the number of museums open changing over time? Are more museums opening than closing?\n\nSome of the variables, such as `DOMUS_Subject_Matter` have quite a lot of missing values which makes \n\nAlthough these definitely warrant further exploration,\n\nGiven the wealth of information around deprivation indices (8 different variables), that's the first aspect of the data that jumps out. How does the number of museums vary per index of deprivation?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(\n  table(museums$Area_Deprivation_index),\n  cex.axis = 0.5,\n  cex.names = 0.5\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](uk-museums_files/figure-pdf/museums-barplot-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere, `1` is the most deprived, and `10` is the least deprived. This is quite an interesting relationship - there have been more museums in places with a moderate level of deprivation compared to higher or lower level. This might feel a little bit counter-intuitive, we might expect there to be more museums in more affluent areas. But looking at the total number of museums in the data per index of deprivation doesn't tell us the whole story. How many of these museums were open at once? How many are still open today? \n\nTo get a better understanding of the relationship between deprivation and the number of museums, we could look at how the number of museums changed for each index of deprivation has changed since 1960 (the earliest date in the data set). Then we might be able to tell whether more are opening or closing, and how this varies across the different levels of deprivation.\n\n### Exploratory sketches\n\nWe have 10 deciles of deprivation, so we'll have 10 time series that we want to plot that show the number of museums over time. There are different options for plotting time series like this. We need to think about some different choices:\n\n* What type of *geometry* will we use? Lines, points, shaded areas? Lines are the most common approach for \n* Do we plot all 10 lines on the same chart and use color to denote the different levels of deprivation?\n* Or do we use faceting to split it into multiple smaller plots by deprivation index?\n\nIf we go with line charts, and faceting by deprivation index, that might look something like this: \n\n![](images/sketch-museums.png){#fig-museums-sketch fig-align=\"center\" fig-cap=\"Initial sketch of a facetted plot showing change over time for each level of deprivation.\"}\n\nWe could achieve something this type of plot using `geom_line()` and `facet_wrap()` from {ggplot2} \\index{ggplot2!facet\\_wrap} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_line}. We've talked about faceting before in both Chapter ...(1) and Chapter ...(2) but we haven't really thought much about the layouts of those facets. In Chapter ...(1), we used faceting with only 3 categories, where the layout choice is fairly obvious: either one column or one row. In Chapter ...(2), we used `facet_grid()` where the number of levels in two factor variables define the number of rows and columns. Here, we have a little bit more flexibility and we might want to think about controlling that layout. \\index{ggplot2!facet\\_grid}\n\nIf we leave it to the default options, {ggplot2} usually tries to coerce it into something *square-ish*. Here, it would likely give us a 3x4 grid filled with 10 plots (for the 10 levels of deprivation) and 2 blank spaces. It's not always possible, but plots without those blank spaces often look a lot cleaner and tidier. We could do either a 5x2 (or 2x5) grid, or a 10x1 (or 1x10) grid to fit our small multiple plots into a perfect rectangle. A 5x2 grid works better here since we don't want to make a very wide but very short plot.\n\n## Preparing a plot\n\nSo let's get started on preparing the data to create this plot!\n\n### Data wrangling\n\nThis is one of those very *real* datasets -
