The website states that *\"each main entry in the database represents a timezone for a set of civil-time clocks that have all agreed since 1970.\"* Many websites use the data in the IANA tz database to operate.\n\nThe time zones data was used as a [\\#TidyTuesday dataset in March 2023](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-03-28/readme.md), where the data wrangling code was adapted from code by [Davis Vaughan](https://gist.github.com/DavisVaughan). There are actually four data sets included but we'll focus on the `timezones` data for now. We can load the data in using the `tt_load()` function from the {tidytuesdayR} package [@tidytuesdayR]: \\index{tidytuesdayR!tt\\_load}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2023-03-28\")\ntimezones <- tuesdata$timezones\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe data contains information for 4 different variables on 337 time zones. The `zone` column contains the time zone name; the `latitude` and `longitude` columns contain coordinates for the time zones *principal location* e.g. biggest city; and the `comments` column contains comments from the original time zone definition file.\n\n## Exploratory work\n\nLet's start by looking at what the `timezones` data looks like!\n\n### Data exploration\n\nWhen we inspect the first few rows of the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(timezones)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  zone       latitude longitude comments\n  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>   \n1 Africa/Ab…     5.32     -4.03 <NA>    \n2 Africa/Al…    36.8       3.05 <NA>    \n3 Africa/Bi…    11.8     -15.6  <NA>    \n4 Africa/Ca…    30.0      31.2  <NA>    \n5 Africa/Ca…    33.6      -7.58 <NA>    \n6 Africa/Ce…    35.9      -5.32 Ceuta, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nthe first thing that jumps out is the `comments` column which appears to have a lot of missing data. Let's plot it to confirm, making use of the `is.na()` function to plot only the counts of missing and non-missing data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(\n  table(is.na(timezones$comments)),\n  cex.axis = 0.5,\n  cex.names = 0.5\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A bar chart of the number of missing values in the `comments` column, where `TRUE` represents missing.](time-zones_files/figure-html/timezones-barplot-na-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlmost 40% of the time zones have no comments associated with them. Inspecting the data further tells us that these comments typically offer clarification or an alternative for the timezone name. Although we could explore how the presence of these comments varies across the globe, we'll use `select()` from {dplyr} to drop the `comments` column for now since it's not the most interesting thing to plot in the data.\n\nThe first column, `zone`, contains information on the timezone name - it's typically in the form of `\"Continent/City\"`. To explore the spread of time zones across continents, we need to split this variable into two (or extract just the continent name from the timezone name). We can use `separate_wider_delim()` from {tidyr} to create two new columns from the `zone` column, splitting on the `/` character. Some of the timezone names have two `/` in their name e.g. `\"America/North_Dakota/New_Salem\"` meaning there are *too many* pieces for two columns. We can tell `separate_wider_delim()` to merge the last pieces since it still uniquely specifies the location. \\index{dplyr!select} \\index{tidyr!separate\\_wider\\_delim}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntimezones_data <- timezones |>\n  dplyr::select(-comments) |> \n  tidyr::separate_wider_delim(\n    cols = zone,\n    delim = \"/\",\n    names = c(\"continent\", \"place\"),\n    too_many = \"merge\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, we can explore how many time zones there are per continent:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(\n  table(timezones_data$continent),\n  cex.axis = 0.5,\n  cex.names = 0.5\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A bar chart of the number of defined time zones in each  of nine geographic regions.](time-zones_files/figure-html/timezones-barplot-loc-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that, actually, the first part of the time zone names don't quite map to continents since there are nine values - but they do map onto large geographic regions. \n\nOf course, when we have coordinate data, the most obvious thing to do is plot those coordinates on a map!\n\n### Exploratory sketches\n\nGiven that we have a latitude and longitude data for the principal locations (usually largest cities) within each time zone, the first map idea that springs to mind is a world map with the time zone locations plotted as points:\n\n![Initial sketch of time zone locations as points on a world map.](images/sketch-time-zones.png){#fig-time-zones-sketch fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe could color the points based on the geographic region (continent) that they are within. as we've already seen, if we do this in {ggplot2}, coloring based on a variable automatically adds a legend to the chart. Instead of the traditional legend using colored squares next to the category label, we could add our own custom legend - using a bar chart. The bars will shown the number of time zones per region, and be colored in the same way as the points on the map. This bar chart legend below the map doesn't take up any more space than a traditional legend, but it does add information (or at least makes the existing information quicker and easier to process).\n\n![Initial sketch of points on a world map with text in the lower left corner, and a bar chart as a legend in the bottom right.](images/sketch-time-zones-2.png){#fig-time-zones-sketch fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nA title and subtitle can be added below the map, next to the bar chart. Positioning the text in a more square layout (rather than a long string of text across the top of the chart) make sit easier to read, and helps to prevent the visualisation from becoming very wide and short.\n\n## Preparing a plot\n\nTo make our plot, we need to get some background map data and understand how to work with multiple spatial data files at once.\n\n### Maps with {rnaturalearth}\n\nBefore we start plotting points on a map, we need a map of the world that we can use as a background to show the underlying countries. \nIn @sec-doctors, we used `map_data` from {ggplot2}. Here, let's look at an alternative using the {rnaturalearth} package [@rnaturalearth]. \n\nThe {rnaturalearth} package allows you to interact with [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) map data. You can download polygons for different geographic regions using the `ne_countries()` function. The default is to download data for all countries: \\index{rnaturalearth!ne\\_countries}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nworld <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tip-timezones-rnatearth .callout-tip}\n\n## Polygons for a specific country with {rnaturalearth}\n\nIf you wanted only the polygon(s) for a specific country or region, you can specify the `country` argument:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuk <- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(country = \"united kingdom\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor specified countries, the `ne_states()` function provides administrative level 1 polygons e.g. major within-country regions such as states.\n\n:::\n\nThe default output from the `ne_countries()` function is an `sf` object - where `sf` stands for *Simple Features*. Simple Features is a standardised model for representing geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons in spatial databases and geographic information systems (GIS). The {sf} package [@sf] implements simple features in R, allowing simple features to be represented as a `data.frame` (or `tibble`). \\index{sf} \n\nSince `sf` objects in R can be thought of as fancy data.frames, this means they can be plotted using {ggplot2}. In fact, {ggplot2} has built-in capabilities for plotting `sf` objects - through the `geom_sf()` function. That means that we can build maps from `sf` objects, in the same we we build other types of charts: by starting with the `ggplot()` function, and then layering on the `geom_sf()` geometry: \\index{ggplot2!ggplot} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_sf}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nbg_map <- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world)\nbg_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Map of the world showing country outlines, with the default gray background.](time-zones_files/figure-html/fig-timezones-bg-map-1.png){#fig-timezones-bg-map}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou'll notice that there's one key difference - there's no aesthetic mapping using the `aes()` function. Since the spatial coordinates are embedded within the `sf` object, there's no need to explicitly map the `x` and `y` variables. The `geom_sf()` function can directly extract and use the embedded coordinates for plotting.\n\n### Spatial objects with {sf}\n\nThough you can combine `geom_sf()` with other geometries, such as `geom_point()`, it's often easier to convert the other geometries to `sf` objects first. The main reason for this is to ensure the *coordinate reference system (CRS)* is the same for both geometries. Coordinate reference systems define how the three dimensional nature of the earth is mapped onto a two-dimensional projected map. There are many different coordinate reference systems, each commonly used for different areas of the world. If you're combining multiple spatial objects, they may have different coordinate reference systems. For example, using the British National Grid (BNG) CRS, London has the following coordinates: `X = 492983` and `Y = 188837`. Under the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) CRS, London has the following coordinates: `Longitude (X) = 1.200235W` and `Latitude (Y) = 53.870659N`. You can imagine how these two coordinates cannot be plotted on the same map without transforming them first. \n\nIn R, you use the {sf} to set or transform between different coordinate reference systems. The easiest way is by using EPSG codes - numerical identifiers assigned to specific coordinate reference systems. The WGS84 uses EPSG code `4326`. This is the coordinate reference system used in the `world` data that we're using for the background map. You can check using the `st_crs()` function from {sf} which retrieves the CRS from an object: \\index{sf!st\\_crs}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsf::st_crs(world)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: WGS 84 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo make sure the CRS of the `timezones` data matches the CRS of the `world` data, we can set the CRS of the `timezones` data as `4326`. At the moment, the `timezones` data is not a spatial object - it's just a simple `data.frame` that contains two columns with latitude and longitude information. First, we need to convert it into an `sf` object using the `st_as_sf()` function from {sf}, also specifying the column names that relate to the coordinates data. \\index{sf!st\\_as\\_sf} \n\nThe latitude and longitude coordinates given in the `timezones` data are given in the `EPSG:4326` CRS, so we don't need to convert the CRS - just set it. We know it's in `EPSG:4326` because this information is given to us with the data. We can use the `st_set_crs()` to set the coordinate reference system to `EPSG:4326` \\index{sf!st\\_set\\_crs}.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntimezones_sf <- timezones_data |>\n  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\")) |>\n  sf::st_set_crs(4326)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tip-timezones-crs .callout-tip}\n\n## Dealing with an unknown CRS\n\nIf you don't know which CRS your coordinates are in, the best thing to do is go back to the source of the data to see if you can find that information. Otherwise, you may wish to try the `guess_crs()` function from {crsuggest} [@crsuggest] which will *guess* potential coordinate reference systems for data that are lacking a defined CRS. \\index{crsuggest!guess\\_crs}\n\n:::\n\n### The first plot\n\nSince the time zones coordinates are now stored as an `sf` object, we can plot it in the same way as the `world` data. We pass in the `timezones_sf` object to the `data` argument, and specify that we want to color the points based on the `continent` column by passing this into the `color` argument inside the `aes()` function: \\index{ggplot2!aes} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_sf}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbasic_map <- bg_map +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = timezones_sf,\n    mapping = aes(color = continent)\n  )\nbasic_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points representing different time zone locations on a world map, with points colored by continent and a legend indicating color mapping on the right of the map.](time-zones_files/figure-html/fig-timezones-basic-map-1.png){#fig-timezones-basic-map}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe now have a basic map with points colored by region, and the default legend added on the right hand side. Let's get started on a better, custom legend.\n\n## Creating a custom legend\n\nBefore we create a new legend for the map, we need to define which colors will be used in the legend (and the rest of the plot).\n\n### Colors\n\nAs we've done in previous chapters, we start by defining a text color, highlight color, and background color as variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntext_col <- \"#2F4F4F\"\nhighlight_col <- \"#508080\"\nbg_col <- \"#F0F5F5\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we define a named vector of colors, mapping the names of the regions to different hex codes. It can be difficult to find a qualitative color palette with enough colors (one for each of the nine regions) that remains colorblind safe. Paul Tol discusses several options for qualitative palettes in his [*Colour schemes and templates* blog post](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/) [@Tol2021]. Here, we use the *muted qualitative color scheme* palette [@Tol2021] which has 10 colors (including a pale grey for missing data) and is colorblind safe:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol_palette <- c(\n  \"#CC6677\", \"#332288\", \"#DDCC77\",\n  \"#117733\", \"#88CCEE\", \"#882255\",\n  \"#44AA99\", \"#999933\", \"#AA4499\"\n)\nnames(col_palette) <- unique(timezones_sf$continent)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Fonts\n\nSimilarly, we also load any fonts we want to use. Again, for this visualisation we're using Google Fonts, so we can make use of the `font_add_google()` function in {sysfonts}. \\index{sysfonts!font\\_add\\_google}  For the title, we'll use the *Fraunces* font - an *old style* serif font inspired by 20th century typefaces. For the body font, we'll use *Commissioner* - a sans serif font. As we've done in previous chapters, we use `showtext_auto()` to use the {showtext} automatically for plotting fonts, and set the desired resolution using `showtext_opts()` to set the dpi. \\index{showtext!showtext\\_auto} \\index{showtext!showtext\\_opts}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Commissioner\")\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Fraunces\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\nshowtext::showtext_opts(dpi = 300)\nbody_font <- \"Commissioner\"\ntitle_font <- \"Fraunces\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Bar chart legend\n\nThere are many ways to make a bar chart in {ggplot2} - the two most often used are `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()`. What's the difference? Well, `geom_bar()` is essentially a special version of `geom_col()` that counts up how many observations are in each category for you. For this visualisation, we're going to use the category counts for other purposes besides just defining the height of the bars so we'll do the counting ourselves and use `geom_col()` instead. \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_col} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_bar}\n\nWe'll use the `count()` function from {dplyr} to count how many observations of each geographical region are present in the `continent` column. We could use either the `timezones_sf` data or the `timezones_data` here as the input data. If you try both, you'll notice that, as we expect, the count column (`n`) is the same in both cases, but that the two outputs are not identical! When you run `dplyr::count(timezones_data, continent)`, you get a 2 column `data.frame`. When you run `dplyr::count(timezones_sf, continent)` you get an 3 column `data.frame` that remains an `sf` object. This is because the `geometry` column in `sf` can described as *sticky* - you often (though not always) want the `sf` class to be preserved after any operations. You can remove it using the `st_drop_geometry()` function from {sf}: \\index{sf!st\\_drop\\_geometry} \\index{dplyr!count}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbar_data <- timezones_sf |>\n  dplyr::count(continent) |>\n  sf::st_drop_geometry()\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's plot a basic bar chart, by starting (as we always do) with passing our new `bar_data` object into the `ggplot()` function. We also add the aesthetic mapping via the `aes()` function and place the `continent` on the x-axis and the count (`n`) on the y-axis. We then draw the columns of the bar chart using `geom_col()`: \\index{ggplot2!ggplot} \\index{ggplot2!aes} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_col}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n    data = bar_data,\n    mapping = aes(x = continent, y = n)\n  ) +\n  geom_col()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar chart showing the number of time zone locations in each continent.](time-zones_files/figure-html/fig-timezones-bar-plot-0-1.png){#fig-timezones-bar-plot-0}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo make it work effectively as a legend, we need to do two things:\n\n* Color the bars based on the `continent` column.\n* Add labels directly to the bars instead, and remove the x-axis labels and legend.\n\n::: {#tip-timezones-bar-colors .callout-tip}\n\n## Adding color to bar charts\n\nIf you were just creating a normal bar chart (not to be used a legend) then adding colors to the bars might make your plot look brighter but it doesn't add any additional information. The categories can already be distinguished by the labels on the x-axis.\n\n:::\n\nLet's remake our bar chart, this time also mapping `fill` and `label` to the `continent` column in the aesthetic mapping. Adding `label` to the aesthetic mapping in `ggplot()` won't affect our bar chart in any way since we aren't (yet) adding `geom_text()` but there's no harm in adding it as a global aesthetic mapping here anyway. We'll also use `scale_fill_manual()` to set the colors used to those defined in the `col_palette` vector we created earlier. \\index{ggplot2!scale\\_fill\\_manual} \\index{ggplot2!ggplot} \\index{ggplot2!aes} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_col}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbar_plot <-\n  ggplot(\n    data = bar_data,\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = continent, y = n,\n      fill = continent, label = continent\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = col_palette\n  )\nbar_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar chart showing the number of time zone locations in each geographical region, with different colors for each region.](time-zones_files/figure-html/fig-timezones-bar-plot-1-1.png){#fig-timezones-bar-plot-1}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we can add the text labels directly to the bars. But where should they go? It's quite common to add category labels in line with the end of the bar but that might not work well here. If we add labels within the bars, for regions with few time zones where the bars are short, the text will be very squashed. If we add labels outside the bars, for regions with many time zones where the bars are long, the text will run off the graph or extend the height of the visualisation. Neither is ideal. But maybe we could have the best of both worlds. We want to add labels under the following conditions:\n\nWhen the bars are long, text should:\n\n* appear inside the bar and be right-aligned;\n* be light in color to contrast the dark bar backgrounds;\n\nAnd conversely, when the bars are short, text should:\n\n* appear outside the bar and be left-aligned;\n* be dark in color to contrast the light plot background;\n\nIt might take a little bit of trial and error to find the value that defines a bar as being *short* or *tall*. Here, we'll use `45`. If a region has more than `45` time zones, it's classed a *tall* bar. Otherwise, it's *short*. \n\nWe want to map the alignment and color of the text to a (transformation of) the `n` column in the data set. This sounds like something that should go into an aesthetic mapping in the `aes()` function. We already know the `color` argument can be used to map the text color. The `hjust` and `vjust` arguments are used for horizontal and vertical positioning of text. Unfortunately, within the `geom_text()` function, neither `hjust` nor `vjust` can be used inside the `aes()` function. \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_text} \n\nLuckily, the {ggtext} package once again comes to the rescue! We can use the `geom_textbox()` function from {ggtext} instead of `geom_text()`. It works very similarly to `geom_text()` but it allows us to map variables to `hjust` and `vjust`. \\index{ggtext!geom\\_textbox}\n\nWe'll use `case_when()` from {dplyr} to specify the settings for the `hjust` argument, depending on the value of `n`. When `n` is greater than `45`, `hjust` should be `1` to use right alignment, otherwise it should be `0` to use left alignment. If you wanted to, you could create a new column in the data instead of using `case_when()` directly inside the `aes()` function. \\index{dplyr!case\\_when} \n\nWhen using `geom_textbox()`, we need to specify both `hjust` and `halign`. Since, the draws a box, we need to control both (i) the alignment of the box relative to the coordinates using `hjust`, and (ii) the alignment of the text within the box relative to the edges of the box using `halign`. Within `geom_textbox()` we also use `orientation = \"left-rotated\"` to rotate the text anti-clockwise by 90 degrees (similar to using `angle = 90` in `geom_text()`). We can remove the background fill color and box outline by setting both `fill = NA` and `box.color = NA`, and set the size and font family options using the `size` and `family` arguments (where we pass in our `body_font` variable we defined earlier).\n\n::: {#tip-timezones-text-align .callout-tip}\n\n## Alignment of text\n\nIn {ggplot2}, `hjust` (and `halign`) controls horizontal alignment and `vjust` (and `valign`) controls vertical alignment. When text is rotated, the non-rotated alignment arguments should be used. For example, although we're moving the text up and down, we still use `hjust` to align the text.\n\n:::\n\nWe use a similar process for setting the color of the text - using `case_when()` to specify if the text should use the `bg_col` or `text_col` color based on whether or not it is greater than 45. Note that we wrap the `bg_col` and `text_col` variables inside the `I()` function to use these variables *as is* rather than treating them as a variable to map to. \\index{base!I} \n\nFinally, we can also use `theme_void()` to remove all existing theme elements, and `theme(legend.position = \"none\")` to remove the legend. \\index{ggplot2!theme} \\index{ggplot2!theme\\_void}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlegend_plot <- bar_plot +\n  ggtext::geom_textbox(\n    mapping = aes(\n      hjust = dplyr::case_when(\n        n > 45 ~ 1,\n        TRUE ~ 0\n      ),\n      halign = dplyr::case_when(\n        n > 45 ~ 1,\n        TRUE ~ 0\n      ),\n      color = dplyr::case_when(\n        n > 45 ~ I(bg_col),\n        TRUE ~ I(text_col)\n      )\n    ),\n    family = body_font,\n    size = 2.5,\n    fill = NA,\n    box.color = NA,\n    orientation = \"left-rotated\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\nlegend_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A minimalist bar chart showing the number of time zone locations in each continent, with labels on each bar naming the continent.](time-zones_files/figure-html/fig-timezones-bar-plot-2-1.png){#fig-timezones-bar-plot-2}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we have a much nice looking custom legend.

We can use the `alpha()` function from {ggplot2} to set the transparency to 30% (0.3). \\index{ggplot2!alpha}\n\nWe'll also re-draw the points again with a small adjustment -  let's change the shape that's used for the points. You can set the shape using the `pch` (or `shape`) argument. There are 25 different options available for `pch`, which can be specified using the numbers 1 to 25. The shape we'll use here is a circle with a dot in the middle. Unfortunately, this isn't one of the 25 available options so we'll have to make it ourselves. We can draw the dot in the middle using the default shape but making it a little smaller. We can add the circle by choosing `pch = 21` (which allows you to control both the `fill` and `color` of the shape) and making it a little bit bigger with a transparent fill. \\index{ggplot2!ggplot} \\index{ggplot2!geom\\_sf} \\index{ggplot2!aes}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbasic_map <- ggplot() +\n  # Apply colors to background map  \n  geom_sf(\n    data = world,\n    color = text_col,\n    fill = alpha(highlight_col, 0.3)\n  ) +\n  # Draw points for time zone locations\n  geom_sf(\n    data = timezones_sf,\n    mapping = aes(color = continent),\n    size = 0.4,\n  ) +\n  # Draw outer circle \n  geom_sf(\n    data = timezones_sf,\n    mapping = aes(color = continent),\n    size = 1.6,\n    pch = 21,\n    fill = \"transparent\"\n  )\nbasic_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points representing different time zone locations on a world map, with points colored by geographical region.

Let's set the limits of the x- and y- axes using `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()`. We extend the lower limit of the y-axis beyond the range of the data, leaving blank space at the bottom where we can overlay the text. We also adjust the `breaks` in the x-axis scale to make the grid lines closer together. The choice of grid lines every `15` x values might seem like an odd choice, but every fifteen degrees difference in longitude (x-axis) is approximately one hour of time difference (since Earth rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours, or 15 degrees per hour)! \\index{ggplot2!scale\\_x\\_continuous} \\index{ggplot2!scale\\_y\\_continuous}\n\nIt will take some (probably a lot of) trial and error to figure out exactly how much you need to extend the y-axis by. Here, we want the height of the blank space to be about half the height of the map area. Using `sf::st_bbox(world)` to return the bounding box of the `world` map data, you'll see that the y-axis of the world map ranges between -90 to +83.6. This means extending the y-axis by around 80 or 90 is a good starting point. We also remove the extra padding around the sides by setting `expand = FALSE` inside `coord_sf()`. \\index{sf!st\\_bbox} \\index{ggplot2!coord\\_sf}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naxes_map <- col_map +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(-180, 180, by = 15),\n    limits = c(-190, 190)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(-170, 100)\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(expand = FALSE)\naxes_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points representing different time zone locations on a world map, with points colored by geographical region.

This might be unnecessary for this visualisation since we have our custom bar chart legend, but reinforcing the color mapping won't hurt. Here, we'll use {ggtext} as we did in @sec-chap4 (although you can also use {marquee} as we did in @sec-cats if you prefer). This means we'll be writing HTML `<span></span>` tags and using `glue()` to pass in the colors from `col_palette` vector. Here, we'll take a slightly different approach of calling the variables - using each vector element name instead of the index. This approach is a little more manual, but can be useful if you want the written text to be slightly different to the category name. It's also often a little bit clearer code to read! \\index{glue!glue} \\index{ggtext}\n \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubtitle <- glue::glue(\"Time zones tend to follow the boundaries between countries and their subdivisions instead of strictly following longitude.

We're going to join together the title and subtitle and plot them as one text object, so we also use HTML `<span></span>` tags to set the font size, family, and colour of the title. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitle <- glue::glue(\"<span style='font-size:12pt; font-family:{title_font}; color:{text_col};'>Time Zones of the World</span><br>\")\ntitle_text <- glue::glue(\"{title}{subtitle}\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe add the `social` caption to the map using the `tag` option in the `labs()` function - just as we did in @sec-doctors. When we edit the `theme` elements in the final step, we'll specify a position for the tag. \\index{ggplot2!labs}\n\nUnfortunately, we can't have two `tag`s and since we also want a non-standard position for the title/subtitle text object, we'll use `geom_textbox()` to add it instead. We specify the x- and y- coordinates of where we want the textbox to go (again, lots of trial and error!) and pass the `social` object in for the label. We also use the other arguments in `geom_textbox()` to set the font `size` and `family` as well as specify the alignment of the text and box (just as we did earlier when making the bar chart). The box fill and outline colors are removed by setting their arguments to `NA`. \\index{ggtext!geom\\_textbox} \\index{ggplot2!aes} \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntext_map <- axes_map +\n  # add social icons\n  ggtext::geom_textbox(\n    data = data.frame(x = 0, y = 93, label = social),\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),\n    family = body_font,\n    size = 2.3,\n    fill = NA,\n    box.color = NA,\n    halign = 0.5,\n    hjust = 0.5,\n    valign = 0\n  ) +\n  # add title and subtitle\n  labs(tag = title_text)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Adjusting themes\n\nThe final step is making a few small changes to the {ggplot2} theme. We start by removing all theme elements using `theme_void()` and setting the `base_family` and `base_size` for the text. Although we don't have many text elements in our visualisation controlled by the `theme()` functions, this will still affect the `tag` text. \\index{ggplot2!theme\\_void}\n\nUsing the `theme()` function, we make some further edit to remove the default legend, change the background color to out `bg_col` variable, and add the grid lines back in with an almost transparent `text_col` color. The position of the `tag` text can be set using the `plot.tag.position` argument to place it in the bottom left of the plot. We also use `element_textbox_simple()` from {ggtext} to format the text in the `tag` since it includes the HTML `<span></span>` tags. Within `element_textbox_simple()`, the `maxwidth` argument is used to set the width of the textbox, ensuring the only takes up the left hand side of the blank space at the bottom. The bar chart legend will go on the other side. \\index{ggplot2!theme} \\index{ggtext!element\\_textbox\\_simple} \\index{ggplot2!element\\_rect} \\index{ggplot2!element\\_line} \\index{ggplot2!alpha}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstyled_map <- text_map +\n  theme_void(base_size = 6, base_family = body_font) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(\n      fill = bg_col,\n      color = bg_col,\n    ),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(\n      color = alpha(text_col, 0.1)\n    ),\n    # add and position text\n    plot.tag.position = c(-0.01, 0.12),\n    plot.tag = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(\n      color = text_col,\n      hjust = 0,\n      maxwidth = grid::unit(200, \"pt\"),\n      margin = margin(\n        l = 15, t = 5, b = 10\n      )\n    )\n  )\nstyled_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points representing different time zone locations on a world map, with points colored by geographical region.

For this, we'll use the {patchwork} package [@patchwork] - just as we did in @sec-lemurs to assemble multiple plots into a grid. \n\nIn this visualisation, rather than arranging plots side by side, we instead want to position one plot (bar chart) on top of another (main map). We start with our `styled_map` and add the `legend_plot` on top using the `inset_element()` function. The four positions given in the `inset_element()` function are the left, bottom, right, and top outer bounds of the inset plot. The default unit is `npc` (normalised parent coordinates). In this setting the bottom left is `(0, 0)` and the top right is `(1, 1)`. This means specifying the `left` outer bound as 0.55 tells {patchwork} to start the left hand side of the inset plot 55% of the way in from the left of the main plot. \\index{patchwork!inset\\_element}\n\nWe also remove the added margin from around the edge of the plot using the `theme()` function and setting all of the margins to zero. Remember that when combining a `theme()` with a `patchwork` object, it's added using the `&` operator rather than `+`. \\index{ggplot2!theme}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(patchwork)\nstyled_map + inset_element(legend_plot, 0.55, 0, 1, 0.3) &\n  theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points representing different time zone locations on a world map, with points colored by geographical region.

For example, it's not immediately clear what the bar chart shows. With a little bit of time, readers probably put together the number of dots with the height of the bars but it could be more obvious. Adding numbers to the bar chart would also improve readability. Perhaps this could be with a traditional y-axis, or perhaps as more informative labels. For example,  instead of a label that reads `\"Africa\"`, it could read `\"Africa (18 time zones)\"`.\n\nIf we're talking about improving readability of bar charts, an easy action is to make the bars (and therefore text) horizontal - it's much easier to read text that's the right way up!\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\nEach plot created during the process of developing the original version of this visualisation was captured using {camcorder}, and is shown in the gif below.
