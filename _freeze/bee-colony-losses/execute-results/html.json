However, their numbers are in decline due to factors including habitat loss, pesticide use, and diseases [Brown2009]. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) annually publishes data on honey bee colonies, which includes information about the number of colonies, the size of colonies, the percentage of colonies lost or added, and factors that have been identified as colony health stressors [@bees_data].\n\nThe USDA honey bee colony data was used as a TidyTuesday [@tidytuesday] data set in January 2022, and so can be loaded in using the {tidytuesdayR} package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-01-11\")\ncolony <- tuesdata$colony\nstressor <- tuesdata$stressor\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this version of the data is based on the 2021 release, it includes data up to June 2021. If you want to work with a more recent publication of the data, it can be obtained from [usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d).\n\nTwo different data sets are included. The first, `colony`, contains information about the number and size of bee colonies in each US state per year since 2015. The second, `stressor`, contains information about different sources of health stressors for bee colonies and what percentage of colonies are affected by these stressors, again for different states and time periods.\n\n## Exploratory work\n\nIn this chapter, we'll focus on the `colony` data, where we'll try to build a picture of how bee colony numbers are changing over time.\n\n### Data exploration\n\nLet's start by looking at a quick boxplot of how the number of colonies (`colony_n`) is changing over time, using the base R `boxplot()` function: \\index{graphics!boxplot}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(\n  colony_n ~ year,\n  data = colony,\n  horizontal = TRUE,\n  xlab = \"Number of bee colonies\", \n  ylab = NULL\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Simple boxplot of number of bee colonies per year, showing a highly skewed distribution.](bee-colony-losses_files/figure-html/fig-bees-boxplot-1.png){#fig-bees-boxplot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-bees-boxplot doesn't actually give us much information - except to suggest the distribution of the number of colonies is highly skewed and to suggest there are quite a few high values being classified as outliers. These outliers force the main section of the boxplots to be squashed on the left of the plot, making it difficult to tell if much is changing on average each year. This is also a more general problem with boxplots. There are many examples of data that illustrate the insufficiency of summary statistics, with Anscombe's quartet [@Anscombe1973] being perhaps the most famous example. Boxplots are essentially just summary statistics in disguise. Different data with identical boxplots can actually come from very different distributions [@Matejka2017].\n\nLet's start by trying to understand what's causing these outliers. Are they real values? Are they mistakes in the data? Or have we made an incorrect assumption about the data? To understand this a bit better, let's zoom in on one year, 2020, and look at the number of colonies in each state to understand which states the largest outliers relate to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolony_2020 <- subset(colony, year == 2020)\nboxplot(\n  colony_n ~ state,\n  data = colony_2020,\n  horizontal = TRUE,\n  cex.axis = 0.5,\n  cex.names = 0.5,\n  las = 1,\n  xlab = \"Number of bee colonies\",\n  ylab = NULL\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplot of the number of bee colonies per state, showing an issue with the definition of 'state'.](bee-colony-losses_files/figure-html/fig-bees-boxplot2-1.png){#fig-bees-boxplot2}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough there are a few states (California, Florida, and North Dakota) with a much higher number of colonies, the main issue is that one of the *states* is the entirety of the United States i.e. the sum of all of the other values. You can also see from @fig-bees-boxplot2 that not all states are included individually - an `\"Other States\"` category is also included instead which groups some states (and perhaps regions).\n\n::: {#tip-bees-names .callout-tip}\n\n## Choose appropriate column names\n\nIt's unfortunately not uncommon for a column name to suggest one thing (e.g. each value relates to a state), but for that column to actually include other values as well (e.g. a country). If you're ever naming columns (especially for data you'll share with other people) choose appropriate column names to avoid confusion. For example, `region` would be a more appropriate column name here.\n\n:::\n\nThe other aspect of our data that boxplots don't tell us about is the missingness. Boxplots only plot what's there, not what's not there. It's especially important to remember this step since base R graphics don't warn you about `NA` values in the way that {ggplot2} [@ggplot2] does. So how do we plot data that doesn't exist?\n\nThe {visdat} package [@visdat] is an excellent way quick look. It includes the `vis_miss()` function which, as the name suggests, allows you to get a quick visualisation of which values are missing. To avoid, ..., we'll start by visualising just the data for one state and use the .... \\index{visdat!vis\\_miss}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolony_AL <- subset(colony, state == \"Alabama\")\nvisdat::vis_miss(colony_AL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](bee-colony-losses_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tip-bees-missing .callout-tip}\n\n## Avoid missing patterns about missingness\n\nThese \ntip - how is missing encoded, patterns in data\n\n:::\n\n{naniar} [@naniar] \n\nif we inspect more closely, we see that . a similar pattern can be observed for all states\n\nwhen reporting happens\n\nData unavailable for apr-jun 2019 - \naverage, smoothing seasonal?\nmaybe only look at january\nsimilar problem for end of 2021. \ncould try to impute but so many values are missing\ntry just jan - seasonal effects differ across the US\n\nhttps://canr.udel.edu/maarec/honey-bee-biology/seasonal-cycles-of-activities-in-colonies/\n\nseptember to dec --> october december\n\ncallout missing values\nassumes \nnaniar::replace_with_na\n\n### Exploratory sketches\n\nfor each state, we want to visualise the average number of colonies each year. There are multiple ways we could do this: line charts or area charts are obvious ... . Perhaps even a simple bar chart could be effective here.\n\nHowever, here we'll look at a less common. essentially how many bees are contained within a particular area. \n\n![Initial sketch.](images/sketch-bees.png){#fig-bees-sketch fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Preparing a plot\n\nwe need to:\n\n* Calculate the average number of colonies per year, per state.\n\n### Data wrangling\n\nLet's start by selecting a subset of states to visualize:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstates_to_plot <- c(\n  \"California\", \"North Dakota\", \"Florida\",\n  \"Texas\", \"Idaho\", \"South Dakota\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData unavailable for apr-jun 2019. also for end of 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- colony |>\n  dplyr::filter(\n    state %in% states_to_plot,\n    months == \"October-December\"\n  ) |> \n  dplyr::select(\n    year, state, colony_n\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder by state with highest average in 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstate_levels <- plot_data |>\n  dplyr::filter(year == 2020) |>\n  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(colony_n)) |>\n  dplyr::pull(state)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnow we need to generate points\n\nwe could do something simple, like generate lots of `runif()` uniform distribution, the number of samples from the distribution represents number of bees. However, this approach is likely to lead - since randomness doesn't usually look .. \n\nInstead, we want to generate points that are don't overlap and are at least some minimum distance apart. To do this, we';ll use *Poisson disk sampling*. \\index{Poisson disk sampling}\n\n### Poisson disk sampling with {poissoned}\n\nWe're going to use the {poissoned} package [@poissoned] to ...\n\nThe {poissoned} package isn't currently available on CRAN, so we'll need to install it from GitHub instead. The {remotes} package [@remotes] can be used to install packages from remote repositories, such as GitHub. We can use the `install_github()` function, passing in a character string of the form `\"user/repository\"`: \\index{remotes!install\\_github}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github(\"coolbutuseless/poissoned\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscale with area. each point represents sqrt of 1000 bees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\nbees_grid <- plot_data |>\n  dplyr::rowwise() |>\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    bees = colony_n / 20000,\n    pnts = list(\n      poissoned::poisson_disc(ncols = bees, nrows = bees, cell_size = 1 / bees)\n    )\n  ) |>\n  dplyr::ungroup() |>\n  tidyr::unnest(pnts) |>\n  dplyr::mutate(state = factor(state, levels = state_levels))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncallout setting random seed\n\n\n### The first plot\n\nWe'll create our plot using `geom_point()` since we \n\nneed to make points very small - calif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nbase_plot <- ggplot(data = bees_grid) +\n  geom_point(\n    mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)\n  ) +\n  facet_grid(state ~ year, switch = \"both\")\nbase_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot](bee-colony-losses_files/figure-html/fig-bees-base-plot-1.png){#fig-bees-base-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Advanced styling\n\n### Colors\n\nLet's select some colors for our plot. We won't be mapping any colors to columns in the data, but we still need to define a background color and a color for highlighted elements. To keep the plot looking clean, we'll also use the same color for the text. Similar to @sec-programming, we can select these colors to match the topic of the data. What colors do you think of when you think of bees? Black and yellow.
