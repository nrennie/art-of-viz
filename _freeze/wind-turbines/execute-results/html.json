The Canadian Wind Turbine Database provides information about wind turbines installed in Canada, including their power capacity and geographic location [@turbines_data]. Rather than reading in the data using the **`tidytuesdayR`** package as we've done in previous chapters, let's read in the data directly from the {{< monolink \"https://open.canada.ca/en\" \"open.canada.ca\" >}} website.\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-open .callout-tip}\n\n## Open Government data in Canada\n\nThe Canadian Wind Turbine data contains information licensed under the [Open Government Licence - Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada). You can search for more open data at {{< monolink \"https://search.open.canada.ca/opendata/\" \"search.open.canada.ca/opendata\" >}}. See @sec-doctors for further discussion of open data sources.\n\n:::\n\n### Reading data with **`openxlsx`**\n\nThough the **`readxl`** package [@readxl] package can be used to read Excel files stored locally, it doesn't work for reading in Excel files directly from a URL. We could visit the relevant {{< monolink \"https://open.canada.ca/data/dataset/\" \"open.canada.ca/data/dataset\" >}} website, manually download the file, and then read it in using  **`readxl`**. Alternatively, we can use the **`openxlsx`** package [@openxlsx] which allows us to pass in a URL.\n\nOf course, we still need to know what the URL of this file is. If you visit the following webpage for the wind turbines data ({{< monolink \"https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/79fdad93-9025-49ad-ba16-c26d718cc070\" \"oopen.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/79fdad93-9025-49ad-ba16-c26d718cc070\" >}}), and right-click on the link to the Excel file you can then copy the link address. We save that link address as a character string called `url`. If you plan to download other datasets from the same site, it can be useful to save the main website as the `base_url` variable so that you can reuse this string later.\n\nWe then use the `read.xlsx()` function from **`openxlsx`**, where we pass in the `url` variable to the `xlsxFile` argument: \\index{openxlsx!read.xlsx} \n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_url <- \"https://ftp.cartes.canada.ca/\"\nurl <- paste0(\n  base_url,\n  \"pub/nrcan_rncan/Wind-energy_Energie-eolienne/wind_turbines_database/Wind_Turbine_Database_FGP.xlsx\"\n)\nwind_turbines <- read.xlsx(xlsxFile = url)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_url <- \"https://ftp.cartes.canada.ca/\"\nurl <- paste0(\n  base_url,\n  \"pub/nrcan_rncan/Wind-energy_Energie-eolienne/\n  wind_turbines_database/Wind_Turbine_Database_FGP.xlsx\"\n)\nwind_turbines <- read.xlsx(xlsxFile = url)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nThere are some features of Excel files that can make them more human-friendly but less computer-friendly:\n\n* Multiple sheets\n* Empty rows\n* Merged cells\n\nLuckily, the `.xlsx` file we've downloaded is both human-friendly and computer-friendly so we don't have to deal with these issues right now.\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-excel-1 .callout-tip}\n\n## Dealing with multiple sheets from Excel\n\nExcel files may contain multiple sheets of data. You can use the `sheet` argument in `read.xlsx()` to specify the name or index of the sheet you want to read in. Using the sheet name is usually a little bit more robust, as it means your code can withstand (accidental) changes to the order of sheets.\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-excel-2 .callout-tip}\n\n## Skipping empty rows from Excel\n\nThe `read.xlsx()` function always skips empty rows at the start of the file. However, sometimes the author of the spreadsheet may add a title row then a few empty rows before the *real* data begins. You can use the `startRow` argument to specify which rows the data actually starts on.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-excel-3 .callout-tip}\n\n## Processing merged cells from Excel\n\nMerged cells are hard to deal with because it means your data no longer fits into a nice rectangular structure. It depends on where the merged cells are, and what they contain, how difficult they are to deal with. If they're at the top of the file (e.g. with the title information) then using `startRow` might be enough. Otherwise, setting `fillMergedCells = TRUE` in `read.xlsx()` means that *the value in a merged cell is given to all cells within the merge* [@openxlsx].\n\n:::\n\nWe don't want to have to re-download the data from the URL each time we want to work on it (especially if the data may be updated), so let's save a copy locally. We could simply save the Excel file (or we could have used `download.file()` instead of `read_csv()`). However, it would be better to save it as a CSV file instead because they are smaller in size, and can be opened in a simple text editor. Luckily the `wind_turbines` data is well formatted - there are no merged cells, multiple sheets, or empty rows we need to deal with. This means we can save it as a CSV file using `write.csv()` with an appropriate file name (and setting `row.names = FALSE` to avoid adding an additional column of row names). \\index{utils!write.csv}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite.csv(\n  x = wind_turbines,\n  file = \"data/wind_turbines.csv\",\n  row.names = FALSE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then use either `read.csv()` or `read_csv()` from **`readr``** to read the CSV file back in: \\index{readr!read\\_csv}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwind_turbines <- read_csv(\"data/wind_turbines.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `wind_turbines` data has 6698 rows and 15 columns. The first few rows of the data are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(wind_turbines)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 15\n  OBJECTID `Province/Territory` Project.name          \n     <dbl> <chr>                <chr>                 \n1        1 Alberta              Optimist Wind Energy  \n2        2 Alberta              Castle River Wind Farm\n3        3 Alberta              Waterton Wind Turbines\n4        4 Alberta              Waterton Wind Turbines\n5        5 Alberta              Waterton Wind Turbines\n6        6 Alberta              Waterton Wind Turbines\n# ℹ 12 more variables: `Total.project.capacity.(MW)` <dbl>,\n#   Turbine.identifier <chr>,\n#   Turbine.number.in.project <chr>,\n#   `Turbine.rated.capacity.(kW)` <chr>,\n#   `Rotor.diameter.(m)` <dbl>, `Hub.height.(m)` <dbl>,\n#   Manufacturer <chr>, Model <chr>,\n#   Commissioning.date <chr>, Latitude <dbl>, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `OBJECTID` column is a unique row identifier. The data has a row for each wind turbine - with some of the data given on the turbine level and some data on the project level. For the variables related to project level data, this means values can be repeated multiple times within a column for turbines in the same project.\n\nThe `Province/Territory` column specifies which geographic region the turbine is in, with the `Latitude` and `Longitude` column giving the exact coordinates. The `Project.name` gives the name of the project that each wind turbine is associated with, and `Total.project.capacity.(MW)` the total power capacity of the project in megawatts. The `Turbine.identifier` column gives a unique ID for each turbine - it is a combination of an abbreviation of the project name, and a number identifying the number of the turbine within the project (also listed in the `Turbine.number.in.project` as a fraction of the total number of turbines per project). The capacity (in kilowatts) of each individual turbine is given in `Turbine.rated.capacity.(kW)` (adding up the individual capacities for all turbines in a project gives the value in `Total.project.capacity.(MW)` multiplied by 100).\n\nThe rotor diameter and hub height of each turbine are given by `Rotor.diameter.(m)` and `Hub.height.(m)`, respectively. The manufacturer and model are also given by the `Manufacturer` and `Model` columns. The commissioning date is given in the `Commissioning.date` column - it appears that some may be given on the project level, whereas others vary for turbines within a project. The `Notes` column contains free text data with additional information for some turbines. Most of these values are empty, but the column may provide information about whether the capacity of turbines have changed or assumptions about how values were calculated.\n\n## Exploratory work\n\nThere are quite a few variables that we might be interested in looking at here - particularly since there are several variables about individual turbines that might be related to each other. For example, do turbines with a larger rotor diameter have a higher capacity? What is the relationship between rotor diameter and hub height? Which manufacturers are most common? Which regions have the most turbines? We might also want to look at the spatial distribution of turbines across Canada since we have the geographic coordinates - we'll look at plotting spatial data a little bit later in @sec-doctors, @sec-time-zones, and @sec-house.\n\n### Data exploration\n\nLet's start by exploring the hypothesis that wind turbines with a larger rotor diameter also have a higher capacity. We can make a scatter plot of these two variables as an initial step. The `Turbine.rated.capacity.(kW)` column is currently a character column even though it contains numeric values, so we wrap the column in `as.numeric()` before plotting it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(\n  x = wind_turbines$`Rotor.diameter.(m)`,\n  y = as.numeric(\n    wind_turbines$`Turbine.rated.capacity.(kW)`\n  ),\n  xlab = \"Rotor diameter (m)\",\n  ylab = \"Turbine rated capacity (kW)\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot showing the relationship between rotor diameter and turbine capacity.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-scatter-1.png){#fig-turbines-scatter}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatter plot highlights a few issues:\n\n* We get a warning message about `NA` values.\n  \n  > `Warning message: In xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : NAs introduced by coercion`\n  \n  This comes from the `as.numeric` transformation of the `Turbine.rated.capacity.(kW)` column. If we inspect this column more closely, you'll see that there are a few unusual values such as `\"1903/2126/2221\"`. If we look at the `Notes` column for an explanation, we can see that these values exist because `\"Some turbines derated such that the farm has an maximum operating capacity of 180 MW\"`. Unfortunately, we don't know which individual turbines this derating applies to which makes it difficult to create a scatter plot.\n\n* The other issue with this scatter plot is that many of the observations are the same, but it's not shown clearly on the plot. If we later wanted to fit some statistical models to explore this relationship further, a common assumption is that each observation is independent. That's not true here - many individual turbines belong to the same project, and so are the same model with the same rotor diameter and capacity. Instead, we might want to group the unique values and use the number of turbines of a particular model as a weighting. This could be better visualized as a bubble chart, with the size of the bubbles showing the number of turbines in each diameter-capacity combination.\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-view .callout-tip}\n\n## Inspecting data\n\nRemember that you can use `View(wind_turbines)` to inspect the data in a more human-readable format. In addition to looking at the data, obtaining summaries of the columns, and creating exploratory graphics with base R, there are many packages available to help with exploratory data analysis. \n\nFor example, the **`GGally`** package [@GGally] makes it easy to create pairwise comparison plots and correlation matrices for the purposes of exploring some or all columns in your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggpairs(\n  data = wind_turbines,\n  columns = c(\n    \"Province/Territory\",\n    \"Hub.height.(m)\",\n    \"Rotor.diameter.(m)\"\n  )\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A 3x3 grid of comparisons between three columns in the `wind_turbines` data relationships using correlation, density plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-ggally-1.png){#fig-turbines-ggally}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nLet's instead look at the number of turbines in each region, by creating an ordered bar chart. We use the `table()` function to get a count of the number per region, and `sort()` to order the counts from smallest to largest. We then use the `barplot()` function to make the chart, setting `horiz = TRUE` to make the bars horizontal for easier reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(\n  sort(table(wind_turbines$`Province/Territory`)),\n  las = 1,\n  horiz = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Ordered bar chart showing the number of wind turbines commissioned in each province or territory.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-barplot-1.png){#fig-turbines-barplot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the turbines are located in Ontario, but has this always been the case? We also have information on the commissioning date of each turbine. We could recreate this bar chart for different time periods to see how the geographic spread of turbines has changed over time. We can add `wind_turbines$Commissioning.date` into the `table()` function to create a stacked bar chart for each year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot(\n  table(\n    wind_turbines$`Province/Territory`,\n    wind_turbines$Commissioning.date\n  ),\n  las = 1,\n  horiz = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Ordered bar chart showing the number of wind turbines commissioned in time period, with stacked bars showing how many are in each province or territory.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-barplot-2-1.png){#fig-turbines-barplot-2}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the y-axis of @fig-turbines-barplot-2, the `Commissioning.date` isn't always given as a year. Instead it's sometimes given as a year range. Let's start drafting out a more aesthetically pleasing version of this plot before we deal with processing the `Commissioning.date` data.\n\n### Exploratory sketches\n\nThere are some years for which we have very few observations, and some turbines for which we don't know the exact year of the commissioning date. Rather than plotting the number of turbines per year, let's plot the number of turbines in different multiyear time periods. The choice of these time periods is open to designer choice. For this visualization, let's start by considering four, 5-year time periods: 2000 - 2004, 2005 - 2009, 2010 - 2014, and 2015 - 2019.\n\nRather than making a stacked bar chart for each year, which can make it difficult to compare one region to another, let's look at an alternative: a *waffle chart*. Waffle charts are sometimes referred to as *square pie charts*. Most commonly, they are visualized on a 10x10 grid, with each grid square representing 1%. The colors of the grid squares represent different categories. The advantage of waffle charts over pie charts (and to some extent bar charts), is that it's easy for a user to read the percentages - they can simply count the squares! The disadvantage is that if there is less than 1% of values in a category, there's no easy way to visualise this (although partially colored squares are an option). \\index{waffle chart} \\index{pie chart}\n\nWaffle charts can also be used to show counts rather than percentages. For example, each square may represent a wind turbine and the color of the square the region it is in. For example, a waffle chart of counts might look something like @fig-sketch-turbines.\n\n![Initial sketch of a faceted area charts showing packages use over time](images/sketch-turbines.png){#fig-sketch-turbines fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"\"}\n\nWe can make two slight variations to this basic version of the chart:\n\n* We have 6698 observations to plot which is a lot of individual grid squares. Instead, each square may represent some number of turbines, rather than just one.\n\n* Instead of plotting squares, we could use icons. For example, we could plot an icon of a wind turbine. This variation of a waffle chart can be referred to as a *pictogram*. The icons can be colored based on the region in the `Province/Territory` column. Instead of using a traditional legend that takes up lots of space, we could use colored text within the subtitle as an alternative.\n\n\\index{pictogram} \n\n## Preparing a plot\n\nIn order to make a draft of @fig-sketch-turbines using **`ggplot2`**, there are a few things we need to prepare:\n\n* The `Commissioning.date` column needs processed to deal with the multiyear labels, and grouped into 5-year categories.\n* We need to decide how many wind turbines each icon will represent.\n* Some of the categories in the `Province/Territory` column may need grouped together because they have very small numbers, and might have less than the number of turbines represented by each icon.\n\n### Data wrangling\n\nLet's start by dealing with the `Commissioning.date` column. There are three types of values in here:\n\n* Single year e.g. `\"2019\"`:  this is the ideal scenario and we don't need to do anything.\n* Two years separated by a `/` e.g. `\"2001/2003\"`: there are several options for dealing with this. We could either take the first year, the last year, or (if they are non-consecutive years) a mid-point of the year range. Here, we'll take the last year since this means that all wind turbines with that `Commissioning.date` will definitely have been commissioned by that date.\n* Three years separated by a `\"/\"` e.g. `\"2005/2006/2012\"`: this is more again more complex, but we'll take the last year for the same reasons as above.\n\nEssentially, this means that:\n\n* If there is no `\"/\"` in the `Commissioning.date`, we do nothing.\n* If there is one or more `\"/\"` in the `Commissioning.date`, we extract whatever comes after the last one.\n\nLet's make a function that does exactly that, called `extract_after_last_slash()`. The input this function is a vector of character strings. We start by checking which elements of the input contain a `\"/\"` using `str_detect()` from the **`stringr`** package [@stringr]. We then use `str_match()` from **`stringr`** in combination with a regular expression to extract the element after the last `\"/\"`. If there is no `\"/\"`, the output will be `NA`. The `str_match()` function returns a matrix with the same number of rows as the length of the input, where the first column is the complete match i.e. the input. The second column contains the output we want so we use `[, 2]` to extract it. Finally, we use `if_else()` from **`dplyr`**, to if there was a `\"/\"` then use the output from `str_match()`, otherwise keep the original value. \\index{stringr!str\\_detect} \\index{stringr!str\\_match} \\index{dplyr!if\\_else} \\index{extract\\_after\\_last\\_slash}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nextract_after_last_slash <- function(texts) {\n  has_slash <- str_detect(texts, \"/\")\n  extracted <- str_match(texts, \".*/(.*)$\")[, 2]\n  output <- if_else(has_slash, extracted, texts)\n  return(output)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-ifelse .callout-tip}\n\n## Comparing `if_else()` and `ifelse()`\n\nIf you've used the `ifelse()` function in base R before, you might be wondering why there's a very similarly named function in **`dplyr`** and what's different about it. The main difference is that `if_else()` is a bit more strict about checking whether you're doing what you think you're doing. For example, let's say we have a vector `x` of length 4 and we want to replace the values in `x` that are equal to 0 with something else. If that replacement is of length 3, that doesn't really make sense. Which value in the vector of length 3 should it use? The `if_else()` function highlights this issue with an error, the `ifelse()` function quietly uses the value in the same position. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(1, 0, 2, 3)\nif_else(x == 0, c(4, 5, 3), x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `if_else()`:\n! `true` must have size 4, not size 3.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nifelse(x == 0, c(4, 5, 3), x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 5 2 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `if_else()` function from **`dplyr`** also preserves types. If you put a `Date` into `if_else()`, then a `Date` is what comes out. That's not always true with `ifelse()`. \\index{base!ifelse} \\index{dplyr!if\\_else}\n\n:::\n\nNow, let's use our new `extract_after_last_slash()` function! Let's start by using `select()` to keep only the columns we actually need: `Province/Territory`, and `Commissioning.date`. We then create a new column called `Year` which is the output of applying the `extract_after_last_slash()` to the `Commissioning.date` column. Initially, this column is still a character string so we convert is to a number using `as.numeric()`: \\index{dplyr!mutate} \\index{dplyr!select} \\index{base!as.numeric}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nturbines_year <- wind_turbines |>\n  select(\n    `Province/Territory`, Commissioning.date\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    Year = extract_after_last_slash(Commissioning.date),\n    Year = as.numeric(Year)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's group the new `Year` column into categories. Our categories span 2000 to 2019, so we start by filtering out any rows that don't fit into this time frame using `filter()` from **`dplyr`**. We then use `case_when()` from **`dplyr`** to actually construct the categories. Here, we make use of the `seq()` function. The `seq(2000, 2004)` code creates a vector `2000 2001 2002 2003 2004`. If any the `Year` is equal to any of those values, then it goes into the `\"2000 - 2004\"` category. And so on. Although R will automatically sort the year categories in the correct order since, in this case, the alphabetical order happens to match the desired order. However, it's good practice to be explicit about what order the categories should have, so we can also set `Year_Group` to be a factor and specify the correct order. \\index{dplyr!filter} \\index{dplyr!mutate} \\index{dplyr!case\\_when} \\index{base!factor} \\index{base!seq}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nturbines_year_group <- turbines_year |>\n  filter(Year >= 2000 & Year <= 2019) |>\n  mutate(\n    Year_Group = case_when(\n      Year %in% seq(2000, 2004) ~ \"2000 - 2004\",\n      Year %in% seq(2005, 2009) ~ \"2005 - 2009\",\n      Year %in% seq(2010, 2014) ~ \"2010 - 2014\",\n      Year %in% seq(2015, 2019) ~ \"2015 - 2019\"\n    )\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    Year_Group = factor(Year_Group, levels = c(\n      \"2000 - 2004\", \"2005 - 2009\",\n      \"2010 - 2014\", \"2015 - 2019\"\n    ))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at the `Province/Territory` categories. Using `count()` and `arrange()` from **`dplyr`**, shows us that there is a big imbalance between the categories: \\index{dplyr!count} \\index{dplyr!arrange}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nturbines_year_group |>\n  count(`Province/Territory`) |>\n  arrange(-n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   `Province/Territory`          n\n   <chr>                     <int>\n 1 Ontario                    2662\n 2 Quebec                     1859\n 3 Alberta                     895\n 4 Nova Scotia                 310\n 5 British Columbia            292\n 6 Saskatchewan                153\n 7 Manitoba                    133\n 8 New Brunswick               119\n 9 Prince Edward Island        104\n10 Newfoundland and Labrador    27\n11 Northwest Territories         4\n12 Yukon                         1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let's rename the `Province/Territory` column to `Region` - a shorter name that will make it a little bit easier to work with. As well as the issue posed by small numbers in categories, twelve categories is also a fairly large number to visualize. We might choose to group together the six smallest categories. The choice of six is fairly arbitrary - but we want a balance between lots of categories with small numbers and few categories with very high numbers. We use `mutate()` and `case_when()` again, to change the value in `Region` to `\"other\"` when the region is one of the six specified values. \\index{dplyr!rename} \\index{dplyr!mutate} \\index{dplyr!case\\_when}\n\nThen, we count up how many turbines were commissioned in each `Year_Group` and `Region` combination using `count()`. We also need to decide how many turbines each icon will represent. It will take a little bit of trial and error to decide on this value - depending on what resolution you want, and how big your final plot will be. Here, we used `20`. This means we divide the turbine count by `20` to obtain the number of icons required, rounding the values as we can only have whole icons. \\index{dplyr!count}\n\nWe filter out any rows where the rounded count is `0` since these won't be plotted. As an aside, it's important to think about these values before we simply throw them away. For example, a region which had 9 turbines in a particular time period won't show up on this plot - since `9/20` is less than 0.5 and so is rounded to `0`. This is an unfortunate limitation of this type of waffle plot variation. \\index{dplyr!filter}\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nturbines_region <- turbines_year_group |>\n  rename(Region = `Province/Territory`) |>\n  mutate(\n    Region = case_when(\n      Region %in% c(\n        \"Northwest Territories\",\n        \"Newfoundland and Labrador\",\n        \"Prince Edward Island\",\n        \"New Brunswick\",\n        \"Manitoba\",\n        \"Saskatchewan\"\n      ) ~ \"other\",\n      TRUE ~ Region\n    )\n  ) |>\n  count(Region, Year_Group) |>\n  mutate(n = round(n / 20)) |>\n  filter(n != 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `Region` variable will be plotted alphabetically be default, but this is rarely the most useful ordering. Instead, let's order by magnitude - with the exception of putting the `\"other\"` category last. \n\nWe start by using the `summarise()` function to add up the number of turbines across the different time periods, getting a total per `Region`. We then `arrange()` them in a descending order (note the `-` in front of the `n`). We then `filter()` out the `\"other\"` category and stick it on the end after extracting the `Region` column using `pull()`. \\index{dplyr!summarise} \\index{dplyr!arrange} \\index{dplyr!filter} \\index{dplyr!pull} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregion_levels <- c(turbines_region |>\n  summarise(n = sum(n), .by = Region) |>\n  arrange(-n) |>\n  filter(Region != \"other\") |>\n  pull(Region), \"other\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's apply these new factor levels to the `Region` column using `mutate()`. Due to a *quirk* of the **`waffle`** package [@waffle] that we'll be using to make our plot (it plots data in the order it appears in the dataset, rather than according to the factor levels), we also sort the data using `arrange()` from **`dplyr`**. \\index{dplyr!arrange} \\index{dplyr!mutate} \\index{base!factor}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- turbines_region |>\n  mutate(\n    Region = factor(Region, levels = region_levels)\n  ) |>\n  arrange(Region)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data is now ready for us to plot!\n\n### Installing Font Awesome fonts\n\nBefore we jump into plotting, we need to do one more thing. In @fig-sketch-turbines, we decided we would use icons in the waffle chart instead of just colored grid squares. So we need to find a way of using icons in R. \n\nIn @sec-programming, we saw how to load fonts into R using the **`sysfonts`** and **`showtext`** packages. Luckily, we can use a similar process here to load in an icon font. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a popular icon toolkit that provides scalable vector icons and social logos (more on this in @sec-cats) [@fontawesome]. You can download font files containing the freely available icons at {{< monolink \"https://fontawesome.com/download\" \"fontawesome.com/download\" >}}, selecting the **Free for Desktop** option. This will download a zip file containing several font files. For this chart, we only need one of those files `Font-Awesome-6-Free-Solid-900.otf`. Save this `.otf` file somewhere you can find it again - such as in a project folder called `fonts`. \\index{Font Awesome} \\index{fonts}\n\nThen, we'll use `font_add()` from **`sysfonts`** [@sysfonts] to load the font into R. The `family` argument is what we want to refer to the font as in R. The `regular` argument is the file path to the `.otf` file. We then use `showtext_auto()` and `showtext_opts()` in exactly the same way as we did for @sec-programming, to use **`showtext`** to render the text.  \\index{sysfonts!font\\_add} \\index{showtext!showtext\\_auto} \\index{showtext!showtext\\_opts}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfont_add(\n  family = \"Font Awesome 6\",\n  regular = \"fonts/Font-Awesome-6-Free-Solid-900.otf\"\n)\nshowtext_auto()\nshowtext_opts(dpi = 300)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-open .callout-tip}\n\n## Installing Font Awesome icons with **`waffle`**\n\nThe **`waffle`** package comes bundled with Font Awesome 5, and you can use the `install_fa_fonts()` function to help you install the font, as an alternative to approach described here. Downloading and installing using the `font_add()` approach will give you access to a wider range of icons since it used the more recent **Font Awesome 6** fonts, and means you don't have to install the font system wide - you only need to load it into R. \\index{waffle!install\\_fa\\_fonts}\n\n:::\n\nNow we're ready to plot!\n\n### The first plot with **`waffle`**\n\nWe're going to use the **`waffle`** package [@waffle] to create our plot. Though the package includes the `waffle()` function which allows you to create a waffle chart directly from a `data.frame`, it also include `geom` functions to allow you to build charts in the way you normally would with **`ggplot2`**. The `geom_waffle()` function can be used to build traditional waffle charts with grid squares, and the `geom_pictogram()` function is used for waffle charts with icons i.e. pictograms. We'll use `geom_pictogram()`. This means we start our plot as we normally do, by passing our data into `ggplot()`. \\index{waffle!geom\\_waffle} \\index{waffle!geom\\_pictogram} \\index{ggplot2!ggplot}\n\nWe then edit the aesthetic mapping in the `geom_pictogram()` function, where we specify the `label` and `color` - both mapped to the `Region` column. This might seem slightly unusual because we don't want the icon to vary with region. Instead, we want to use the same icon for all categories. However, `geom_pictogram()` expects `label` to vary by category, so we map it to region and we'll later use `scale_label_pictogram()` to make them all the same icon. The `values` argument is also a required aesthetic. We use the `n` column in the data to specify how many icons should be plotted for each category. The x and y coordinates are automatically calculated when we use the `geom_pictogram()` function so we don't need to map these out in the `aes()` function.  \\index{ggplot2!aes} \\index{waffle!geom\\_pictogram}\n\nWe also edit a few other parameters of the `geom_pictogram()` function. By default, pictograms are stacked horizontally as this is often easier to read (similar to horizontal bar charts). However, it's also very common to put date variables on the x-axis. Setting `flip = TRUE` will stack the pictogram categories upwards, and allow the date categories to go on the x-axis. Setting `n_rows = 10` means that each row of the pictogram will contain 10 icons (remember that we've flipped rows and columns here). We can edit the `size` of the icons in the same way we would edit the font size in `geom_text()`, for example. It might take a little bit of trial and error to find the right size to make sure icons are large enough to see, but don't overlap. We also need to state that the icons come from Font Awesome 6 by setting `family = \"Font Awesome 6\"` (the same name as the `family` argument used in `font_add()`). \\index{waffle!geom\\_pictogram}\n\nFinally, we add `facet_wrap()` to create a pictogram for each date range, placing them in a single row, and moving the facet label to the bottom of the chart. \\index{ggplot2!facet\\_wrap}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbasic_plot <- ggplot(data = plot_data) +\n  geom_pictogram(\n    mapping = aes(\n      label = Region,\n      color = Region,\n      values = n\n    ),\n    flip = TRUE,\n    n_rows = 10,\n    size = 2.5,\n    family = \"Font Awesome 6\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~Year_Group,\n    nrow = 1,\n    strip.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\nbasic_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pictogram showing the number of turbines per time period in each region, where the region name is showing instead of the icons.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-base-plot-1.png){#fig-turbines-base-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-waffle-prop .callout-tip}\n\n## Proportional waffle charts\n\nBy default, `geom_pictogram()` and `geom_waffle()` both assume that the column mapped to `values` should be plotted as counts. If you'd prefer to plot the values as percentages, set `make_proportional = TRUE`. \n\n:::\n\nWhat you might immediately notice about @fig-turbines-base-plot is that there are no icons. Instead, the plot has printed the `Region` names (even though we've set `family = \"Font Awesome 6\"`). This is because we haven't defined which icons we want to use. To find an appropriate icon and what it's called, we can browse the Font Awesome website at {{< monolink \"https://fontawesome.com/search\" \"fontawesome.com/search\" >}} and search for related icons. For example, we might search for a *wind turbine* icon. Though Font Awesome wind turbine icons do exist, they are unfortunately only available with the Pro version. There are other free icons that sort of fit this theme: `wind`, `bolt` (to represent energy), or `fan` to name a few. We'll use `fan` [@fontawesome]. \\index{Font Awesome}\n\nWe can add `scale_label_pictogram()` from **`waffle`** to our plot to specify the icons. We would normally pass in a vector of icon names to the `values` argument - one icon for each category. However, since we want to use the same icon for all categories, we can simply pass in a single name - taking advantage of the fact that R re-uses elements of vectors. We set `guide = \"none\"` to remove the legend for icons as they are all the same. Alternatively, you can later set `theme(legend.position = \"none\")` as we did in previous chapters to remove the legend. \\index{waffle!scale\\_label\\_pictogram}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nicons_plot <- basic_plot +\n  scale_label_pictogram(\n    values = \"fan\",\n    guide = \"none\"\n  )\nicons_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pictogram showing the number of turbines per time period in each region, with fan icons indicating 20 turbines currently looking overcrowded.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-icons-plot-1.png){#fig-turbines-icons-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also have noticed that the values on the y-axis are incorrect - there definitely more than 15 turbines in the 2010 - 2014 time frame! We'll deal with the axis in the next section.\n\n## Advanced styling\n\nNow we still need to edit the colors used in the plot, add a title and subtitle (including colored text to replace the legend), and edit the axis labels.\n\n### Colors with **`rcartocolor`**\n\nWe start by defining variables for the background and text colors: \\index{color}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbg_col <- \"#FAFAFA\"\ntext_col <- \"black\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's also define a color palette that we'll use for the color of the icons. We're looking for 6 different colors - one for area. The **`rcartocolor`** [@rcartocolor] package provides access to the [CARTOColors](https://carto.com/carto-colors/) color palettes for maps designed by [CARTO](https://carto.com/) [@cartocolors]. Although these palettes were primarily designed for coloring maps, the color palettes are also very effective for other types of graphics. \n\nIn the **`rcartocolor`** package, categorical palettes are referred to as *qualitative* palettes. We can see all available qualitative palettes with a sufficient number of colors using `display_carto_all()`: \\index{rcartocolor!display\\_carto\\_all}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndisplay_carto_all(\n  n = 6, type = \"qualitative\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![All qualitative color palettes with at least 6 colors in the `rcartocolor` package.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-rcarto-1.png){#fig-turbines-rcarto}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the **`rcartocolor`** package has the `scale_fill_carto_d()` function which we could use directly in our plots, we'll still save the color palette as a vector of hex codes to allow us to re-use the colors more easily. As you can see in @fig-turbines-rcarto, in the qualitative palettes in the **`rcartocolor`** package, the last color is often a gray color. That's a great choice for representing missing data, but when we want different colors for categories it doesn't work as well. The trick is to ask for one more color than we need, and then throw away the last element in the color palette. We have 6 categories in our plot, so we ask for 7 colors using the `carto_pal()` function and then extract only the first 6. We'll use the `\"Vivid\"` palette here. \\index{rcartocolor!carto\\_pal} \\index{color}\n\nWe also make the `col_palette` vector a named vector by using the `names()` function, and using `region_levels` as the names. Although this isn't necessary for adding the colors to the plot, it will make it easier to extract the colors and ensure each color is mapped to the correct category label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol_palette <- carto_pal(\n  n = length(unique(plot_data$Region)) + 1,\n  name = \"Vivid\"\n)[1:length(unique(plot_data$Region))]\nnames(col_palette) <- region_levels\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can then pass this `col_palette` vector into `scale_color_manual()` to apply the colors to our plot. Since we'll be using colored text instead of a traditional legend, we set `guide = \"none\"` to remove the legend again. \\index{ggplot2!scale\\_color\\_manual}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol_plot <- icons_plot +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = col_palette,\n    guide = \"none\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Adding styled text with **`marquee`**\n\nWe've already seen in @sec-programming and @sec-museums how to format the title or subtitle text to be bold using the `face = \"bold\"` argument inside `theme()` elements. But what if we want to make only *part* of the text bold? We can use the **`marquee`** package [@marquee] to add styling to text within in a string. The **`marquee`** package allows you to use Markdown syntax in text when you're making graphics in R, including in plots built with **`ggplot2`** or other graphics built with **`grid`**. \\index{marquee}\n\nIn Markdown, to make text bold, you enclose it inside two pairs of asterisks e.g. `**bold text**`. For example, if we wanted to put the entire title in bold font, we could write the title inside `**`. In the caption, we might want to embolden the words `Data` and `Graphic` to highlight that there are two different fields of information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitle <- \"**Canadian wind turbines are mostly found in Ontario**\"\ncap <- \"**Data**: Natural Resources Canada | **Graphic**: N. Rennie\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis type of formatting for the plot caption is something that we might like to re-use across multiple plots. And when we want to re-use code, it's almost always useful to make it into a function. Let's define a function called `source_caption()` which has three arguments:\n\n* `source`: a character string for the source of the data\n* `graphic`: a character string for the attribution of the visualization\n* `sep`: a character string for what should separate the two pieces of text, which has `\" | \"` as a default.\n\nWe then use `glue()` from **`glue`** to stick these three arguments together, and include the bold formatting using `**`. Here we use namespacing (prefixing the function name with the package name and `::`) to make it easier to re-use this function in later chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource_caption <- function(source, graphic, sep = \" | \") {\n  caption <- glue::glue(\n    \"**Data**: {source}{sep}**Graphic**: {graphic}\"\n  )\n  return(caption)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can construct the caption using our new `source_caption()` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncap <- source_caption(\n  source = \"Natural Resources Canada\",\n  graphic = \"N. Rennie\"\n)\ncap\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n**Data**: Natural Resources Canada | **Graphic**: N. Rennie\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that it's identical to the one we manually created earlier. We'll also re-use the `source_caption()` function in later chapters.\n\nLet's move onto the subtitle. In this visualization, the subtitle will also be doubling as a legend as we'll use colored text to denote the different categories. In **`marquee`**, text can be colored by wrapping the text in curly brackets, where the first word is pre-fixed by a period and identifies the color of the text i.e. `{.color text to color}`. For example, `{.red This is red text.}`. \n\nWe want to add the colors and the text to be colored in a programmatic way. We'll use square brackets to subset the values and names stored in the `col_palette` vector. Here, `col_palette[[1]]` extracts the hex code for the color of the first category, and `names(col_palette)[[1]]` extracts the name of the first category.\n\nNormally, when we want to write character strings and insert variables into the string, we'd use `glue()` to combine them. However, the `{}` that we normally use for variables in `glue()` will get mixed up with the `{}` we'll use for text formatting with **`marquee`**. There are a couple of different ways we can get around this problem. One way is changing the delimiters used in `glue()`. For example, by setting `.open = \"[\"` and `.close = \"]\"` inside the `glue()` function. Alternatively, we can use `marquee_glue()` from the **`marquee`** package - an equivalent version of `glue()` that was built to deal with this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nst <- marquee_glue(\n  \"The Canadian Wind Turbine Database contains the geographic location and key technology details for wind turbines installed in Canada.

We'll deal with this when we edit the arguments in `theme()` - we haven't actually used **`marquee`** yet to format the title text!\n\n### Adjusting scales and themes\n\nWe can make a final few tweaks to our plot, to apply the formatting with **`marquee`** and make it look a little bit cleaner. Let's start by adjusting the scales. At the moment, the y-axis ranges from 0 to around 15. We know this isn't correct because we have over 6,500 observations in our data. There are two reasons why the scale of the y-axis is incorrect:\n\n* Each icon represents 20 turbines, so the y-axis labels are currently showing as 20 times smaller than they should be.\n* Within each facet, we row contains 10 icons, so the y-axis labels are currently showing as another 10 times smaller than they should be. \n\nLet's fix that by passing a function into the `labels` argument of `scale_y_continuous()`. The function takes the existing y-axis label, multiplies it by `10`, multiplies it by `20`, and formats it using a thousand separator comma. We set `expand = c(0, 0)` to remove the extra space at the top and bottom of the y-axis. Let's also choose slightly nicer break points for the y-axis - ranging from 0 to 4,000 with breaks every 1,000. Unfortunately, we need to specify the limits and the breaks on the original scale rather than on the label scale e.g. an break point of `15` is actually a break point of `15 * 20 * 10 = 3000`. Adding `coord_fixed()` helps to deal with the overlapping icons issue, by making each icon area square. \\index{ggplot2!scale\\_y\\_continuous} \\index{ggplot2!coord\\_fixed}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscale_plot <- text_plot +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = function(x) {\n      format(\n        x * 10 * 20,\n        big.mark = \",\"\n      )\n    },\n    expand = c(0, 0),\n    breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20),\n    limits = c(0, 20)\n  ) +\n  coord_fixed()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's make a few final edits to tidy up our plot by editing the theme. We'll use `theme_minimal()` as a base theme (making the font size a little bit smaller), and then make a few further edits using the `theme()` arguments. \\index{ggplot2!theme\\_minimal} \\index{ggplot2!theme}\n\nWithin `theme()`, we start by setting `plot.title.position` and `plot.caption.position` to `\"plot\"` to align the title, subtitle, and caption text with the edge of the whole plot, rather than the start of the first panel. Some additional spacing around the edge of the plot is added using `plot.margin` and the background color is edited by using the `fill` and `color` arguments in `element_rect()` for the `plot.background` argument. The gridlines are also made slightly thinner by adjusting `panel.grid.major`. \\index{ggplot2!element\\_rect} \\index{ggplot2!element\\_line} \\index{ggplot2!margin}\n\nFinally, we edit the plot, subtitle, and caption elements and specify them all using `element_marquee()`. By using `element_marquee()`, the Markdown syntax we've applied, such as the bold and colored text, will be rendered correctly. You can adjust the `color`, `size`, `margin` and `hjust` of **`marquee`** text in the same way you would with `element_text()`. If you have some elements of the text rendered with `element_text()` and some rendered with `element_marquee()`, you may notice some differences in the text sizing and spacing. Try setting the size of individual elements with the `size` argument. \\index{marquee!element\\_marquee}\n\nThe `width` argument applies text wrapping, where `width = 1` means the text wraps to the full width of the plot. This is similar to the way that `element_textbox_simple()` from **`ggtext`** works. However, the `width` is not set by default, so if you want the text to wrap it's important to specify the width.\n\n\n::: {#tip-turbines-marquee-req .callout-tip}\n\n## Requirements for using **`marquee`**\n\nThe **`marquee`** package relies on some of the more recent features in the R graphics engine. This means that you need at least version 4.3 of R for **`marquee`** text to render correctly. Not all graphics devices support these new features (especially in Windows) so you might need to adjust the graphics device that R uses. The devices made available through the **`ragg``** package [@ragg] are a good choice. \\index{ragg}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscale_plot +\n  theme_minimal(\n    base_size = 8\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    # spacing around text and plot\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.margin = margin(5, 10, 5, 10),\n    # background and grid lines\n    plot.background = element_rect(\n      fill = bg_col, color = bg_col\n    ),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(\n      linewidth = 0.4\n    ),\n    # format text with marquee\n    plot.title = element_marquee(\n      color = text_col,\n      width = 1,\n      size = 12,\n      margin = margin(b = -10)\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = element_marquee(\n      color = text_col,\n      width = 1,\n      size = 9\n    ),\n    plot.caption = element_marquee(\n      hjust = 0,\n      lineheight = 0.5,\n      size = 8,\n      margin = margin(t = 5)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pictogram showing the number of turbines per time period in each region, with colored text in the subtitle indicating which color maps to each region.](wind-turbines_files/figure-html/fig-turbines-theme-plot-1.png){#fig-turbines-theme-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we're done and ready to save a copy! \\index{ggplot2!ggsave}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(\n  filename = \"wind-turbines.png\",\n  width = 5,\n  height = 0.75 * 5\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThe colored subtitle as an alternative to a legend is effective because it uses much less space than a traditional legend - leaving more room for the data. However, there are some elements of the subtitle that could still be improved. We've discussed already the limitations of waffle plots and pictograms in terms of the lack of representation of categories with small numbers. This means that we had to group some regions together, and so regions with fewer turbines have less information included in the chart. Perhaps the subtitle could be updated to explain to users that each icon represents 20 turbines, and that this means regions with 10 or fewer turbines are not represented.\n\nThere's also some uncertainty around the date used, which isn't really explained in the chart. When processing the `Commissioning.date` column, we used the most recent date but that isn't necessarily always the best choice. A limitation of the data is that we also only have commissioning date, not installation date or date of first operation. This means that perhaps there are some values in the data that suggest a turbine exists in one time period when it hasn't yet been built. \n\nFinally, we've used a `fan` icon because the Font Awesome wind turbine icon is only available in the Pro version. Using a wind turbine icon would be much clearer, and more consistent with the theme of the plot. We could look at using an alternative icon font, or we could perhaps use images instead. See @sec-ggbuild for a description of how we might replace the existing `fan` icons with a wind turbine icon from a different source.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\nEach plot created during the process of developing the original version of this visualization was captured using **`camcorder`**, and is shown in the gif below.

Should you choose a different icon?\n\n* Can you arrange both versions (number and capacity) as a single visualization?
