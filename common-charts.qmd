# Common charts don't need to be boring! {#sec-common-intro .unnumbered}

When you say the word *chart*, there are a few common types of plot that spring to mind: bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts. The fact that these charts are common often makes them good choices for communicating data because they don't require as much effort from a reader to understand. However, some chart designers may see these as *boring* charts because they don't require a lot of time or effort to create, and they're very standard. 

* Chapter @sec-programming will teach you how to make a dumbbell chart with {ggplot2}, and discuss styling charts thematically based on the data they contain.

* Chapter @sec-museums covers line charts, including how to retain clarity and enable better comparisons when plotting many lines.

* Chapter @sec-bees describes the process of transforming data to present it in a different way, and how to arrange a grid of small multiple charts based on different categories.

* Chapter @sec-technology discusses how to use the {ggforce} extension package to build your own customised charts, and convert a bar chart into a gauge chart.
