# Common charts don't need to be boring! {#sec-common-intro .unnumbered}

This is an intro to a part.

These are the chapters, introduced with a phrase that encapsulates them:

* In @sec-programming,

* In @sec-museums,

* In @sec-bees,

* In @sec-technology,

And then a sentence or paragraph about any leftovers.
