# Introduction

*For every child who was told they had to choose between maths and art - you don't.*

## Why visualise data?

## What is #TidyTuesday?

## Background knowledge

## A note about R code

All code in this was created using `r R.version.string`, and a complete list of package versions can be found in the Appendix.

### Base R pipe vs {magrittr} pipe

### Namespacing

You may notice that some of the final images differ slightly from those initially created and published on social media. You might also find some small differences in the code used to produce them if you compare the contents of this book to original scripts in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday). These differences are primarily due to two reasons: (i) packages have been updated and code has been changed to use newer syntax; (ii) some aspects have been omitted here to avoid explaining *everything* in Chapter 1 - but they are all covered and linked to in later chapters!; or (iii) I found a more efficient way of doing something. Any changes are clearly labelled and discussed.
