# Introduction {#sec-intro}

## Who is this book aimed at?

This book is primarily aimed at those who wish to develop their data visualization skills in R. Readers of this book may find a basic knowledge of R, more specifically of the {tidyverse} ecosystem, useful - although all code used in examples is fully explained. Readers do not need to be experienced in {ggplot2}, though this book will also be of interest to those who are. This book will also be of interest to those who are already familiar with R (including {ggplot2}), and wish to develop their skills in designing data visualizations further. It will also interest those who already design data visualizations using other tools, and want to learn how to do the equivalent in R.

## What do you need to know before reading this book?

This book assumes you know the basics of using R and know what the {tidyverse} is. For example, you'll be able to:

* install and load packages
* call a function and save the output to variables

If you're not that familiar with R, any of the following books should provide some good pre-reading:

* **R for Data Science** (Second Edition) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. It can be found online at [r4ds.hadley.nz](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). [@r4ds]

* **R for the Rest of Us: A Statistics-Free Introduction** by David Keyes. It can be found online at [book.rfortherestofus.com](https://book.rfortherestofus.com/). [@r4rest]

* **Learn R: As a Language** by . It can be found online at [www.learnr-book.info](https://www.learnr-book.info/). [@aphalo2024]

## Code style used in this book

There are many different versions of R, many different packages in R, and many different styles of writing code - and there isn't a single *best* way of doing things. You may write code differently from the way you see it written in this book, and that's perfectly fine. Throughout the book, a few choices have been made to keep code consistent:

* In R, the pipe operator *takes the thing on its left and passes it along to the function on its right* [@r4ds]. You can find a full description of the pipe operator in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#sec-the-pipe). The pipe\index{pipe} (`%>%`) was first introduced to R via the {magrittr}\index{magrittr} package. Since version 4.1.0 of R, a version of the pipe (`|>`) has existed in base R. The base R version of the pipe is used throughout the book. Although there are some difference between the two version of the pipe, in this book, they can be used interchangeably.

* Namespacing (the pre-fixing of functions with the package name and `::`) is used for all packages except {ggplot2} and base R packages. Namespacing is useful for two reasons (i) from a learning perspective, it makes it easier to recognize where functions come from and how they connect together, and (ii) from a programming perspective, it reduces conflicts and errors - something we all want less of!

\index{namespacing}

* In this book, we'll primarily use base R for initial exploration and visualization, and then {ggplot2} and it's associated extension packages to create our final graphic in each chapter.

* All software requirements, including a complete list of package versions, can be found in the Appendix.

## Code evolves over time

You may also notice that some of the final images differ slightly from those initially created and published on social media. You might also find some small differences in the code used to produce them if you compare the contents of this book to original scripts in the [github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday) GitHub repository. These differences are likely due to one of four reasons: 

* Packages have since been updated and code has been changed to use newer syntax. Many of the code changes relate to changes in {ggplot2} version 3.5.0;
* Some aspects have been omitted from a visualization to avoid explaining *everything* in the first chapter - but those aspects are all covered and linked to in later chapters;
* After several years of practice, there may be more efficient ways of re-writing code from some of the earlier plots. Any changes are clearly labelled and discussed;
* Some images may be different due to copyright reasons.

## The structure of this book

There are four sections in this book:

* Common charts don't need to be boring!
* Making use of icons, fonts, and text
* Visualizing spatial data
* Weird and wonderful: completely custom charts

Each chapter is a case study of a different visualisation, and follows the same structure:

* **Data**: an introduction to the data set used in each chapter and how to load it into R
* **Exploratory work**: exploring the data and finding a story to visualize
* **Preparing a plot**: data wrangling need to make a first draft of the plot
* **Advanced styling**: edits required to make the plot of publication quality
* **Reflection**: some thoughts on how the visualisation may be improved
