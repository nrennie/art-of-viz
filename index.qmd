Welcome to *The TidyTuesday Cookbook*. TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project which aims to make learning to work with data easier, by providing real-world datasets. Participants are encouraged to explore the data shared via [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) each week, create an output such as a data visualization, and share their output alongside their code, with the community. 

After three years of weekly contributions, I've worked with around 150 datasets and created over 150 data visualizations. Each chapter of this book will cover a different data visualisation, showing: the data exploration process; the choice of data visualisation type; the initial design ideas with hand-drawn sketches; the first build of a plot; and the iterative process of styling plots. For each plot, full R code is be provided and explained for each step of the creative process. None of the visualizations you'll see were created specifically for this book - each one is an original data visualization created using real TidyTuesday datasets over a series of years. Think of each chapter as a case study starting with a new data set you've never seen before, and working through a process to get to an insightful, artistic visualization. This book is all about that process. Sometimes the data is messy. Sometimes the code is *hacky*. Sometimes, upon reflection, the data could be visualized better. 

Data visualization can be a very effective and efficient means of communicating information. Visualizing your data typically serves one of two purposes: (i) as part of exploratory analysis to help uncover discrepancies in data and identify interesting relationships to measure; or (ii) to communicate key insights and messages to a broader audience. The case-study nature of this book means that we'll talk about both of these aspects, though we 'll focus mostly on the second. Choosing an appropriate type of visualization and making careful choice about design can clarify the message you are trying to convey to a reader. That does not necessarily mean that every chart must follow a set of *rules* and stick to a rigid format. Instead, data visualization is a blend of science and creativity - many of the key *landmark* data visualizations held up as excellent examples don't fit into the standard categories of bar charts, scatter plots, or line graphs. 

That being said, the visualizations in this book are not necessarily always the most effective choice of visualization for the data and relationship shown. Rather, this book aims to show you examples of the end-to-end process of creating data visualizations, with a focus on the technical details of building them in R. You'll see some non-standard solutions and unusual ideas that you can use to transform your data visualizations.
