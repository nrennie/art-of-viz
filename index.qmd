# Preface {.unnumbered}

\#TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project which aims to make learning to work with data easier, by providing real-world datasets. Participants are encouraged to explore the data shared via [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) each week, create an output such as a data visualization, and share their output alongside their code, with the community.

After three years of weekly contributions, I've worked with around 150 datasets and created over 150 data visualizations. This book will present a subset of these visualizations, and describe the process used to create them. Each chapter will cover a different data visualization, showing: the data exploration process; the choice of data visualization type; the initial design ideas with hand-drawn sketches; the first build of a plot; and the iterative process of styling plots.
