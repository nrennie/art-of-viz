    "text": "About the author\nNicola Rennie is a Lecturer in Health Data Science within the Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics at Lancaster University. She holds a PhD in Statistics and Operational Research, focusing on analysing and visualising transport demand. Her current research is focused on applications of statistics and machine learning to health-related data, communicating statistics, and the effective teaching of data science. She has experience of teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, in courses covering fundamentals of data science, population health, and statistical programming. Nicola has also previously worked in data science consultancy, and delivered training courses covering topics including advanced data visualisation with R, statistical modelling, and reproducible reporting. She is the author and maintainer of several R packages, including multiple {ggplot2} extension packages. Nicola is a regular speaker at R and data science meetups, and is the current chapter organiser of R-Ladies Lancaster. She is co-author of the Royal Statistical Society’s Best Practices for Data Visualisation Guide, and an active member of the Royal Statistical Society. Several of her data visualisations have been long-listed at the Information is Beautiful Awards."

    "text": "What is #TidyTuesday?\n#TidyTuesday (Community 2023) is a weekly social data project which aims to make learning to work with data easier, by providing real-world datasets. Participants are encouraged to explore the data shared via GitHub each week, create an output such as a data visualisation, and share their output alongside their code, with the community.\nAfter three years of weekly contributions, I’ve worked with around 150 datasets and created over 150 data visualisations. This book will present a subset of these visualisations, and describe the process used to create them. Each chapter will cover a different data visualisation, showing: the data exploration process; the choice of data visualisation type; the initial design ideas with hand-drawn sketches; the first build of a plot; and the iterative process of styling plots."

    "text": "Background knowledge\nThis book is primarily aimed at those who wish to develop their data visualisation skills in R. Readers of this book may find a basic knowledge of R, more specifically of the {tidyverse} ecosystem, useful though all code used in examples is fully explained. Readers do not need to be experienced in {ggplot2}, though this book will also be of interest to those who are. Readers of this book will be of interest to those who are already familiar with R (including {ggplot2}), and wish to develop their skills in designing data visualisations further. It will also be of interest to those who already design data visualisations using other tools, and want to learn how to do the equivalent in R."

    "text": "A note about R code\nAll code in this was created using r R.version.string, and a complete list of package versions can be found in the Appendix.\n\nBase R pipe vs {magrittr} pipe\nIn R, the pipe operator takes the thing on its left and passes it along to the function on its right (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund 2023). You can find a full description of the pipe operator in R for Data Science. The pipe (%&gt;%) was first introduced to R via the {magrittr} package. Since version 4.1.0 of R, a version of the pipe (|&gt;) has existed in base R. The base R version of the pipe is used throughout the book. Although there are some difference between the two version of the pipe, in this book, they can be used interchangeably.\n\n\nNamespacing\nNamespacing (the pre-fixing of functions with the package name and ::) is used for all packages except {ggplot2} and base R packages. Namespacing is useful for two reasons (i) from a learning perspective, it makes it easier to recognise where functions come from and how they connect together, and (ii) from a programming perspective, it reduces conflicts and errors - something we all want less of!\n\n\nChanges to from earlier versions\nYou may notice that some of the final images differ slightly from those initially created and published on social media. You might also find some small differences in the code used to produce them if you compare the contents of this book to original scripts in the GitHub repository. These differences are likely due to one of four reasons:\n\npackages have since been updated and code has been changed to use newer syntax;\nsome aspects have been omitted from a visualisation to avoid explaining everything in Chapter 1 - but those aspects are all covered and linked to in later chapters;\nafter many years of practice, there may be more efficient ways of re-writing code from some of the earlier plots. Any changes are clearly labelled and discussed;\nsome images may be different due to copyright reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity, R4DS Online Learning. 2023. “Tidy Tuesday: A Weekly Social Data Project.” https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023.
