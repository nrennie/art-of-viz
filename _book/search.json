    "text": "Preface\n#TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project which aims to make learning to work with data easier, by providing real-world datasets. Participants are encouraged to explore the data shared via GitHub each week, create an output such as a data visualization, and share their output alongside their code, with the community.\nAfter three years of weekly contributions, I’ve worked with around 150 datasets and created over 150 data visualizations. This book will present a subset of these visualizations, and describe the process used to create them. Each chapter will cover a different data visualization, showing: the data exploration process; the choice of data visualization type; the initial design ideas with hand-drawn sketches; the first build of a plot; and the iterative process of styling plots.\nWelcome to the online version of The #TidyTuesday Cookbook by Nicola Rennie.\nThis book is currently a work-in-progress.",

    "section": "1.1 Why visualize data?",
    "text": "1.1 Why visualize data?\nData visualization can be a very effective and efficient means of communicating information. Visualizing your data typically serves one of two purposes: (i) as part of exploratory analysis to help uncover discrepancies in data and identify interesting relationships to measure; or (ii) to communicate key insights and messages to a broader audience. The case-study nature of this book means that we’ll talk about both of these aspects, though we ’ll focus mostly on the second.\nChoosing an appropriate type of visualization and making careful choice about design can clarify the message you are trying to convey to a reader. That does not necessarily mean that every chart must follow a set of rules and stick to a rigid format. Instead, data visualization is a blend of science and creativity - many of the key landmark data visualizations held up as excellent examples don’t fit into the standard categories of bar charts, scatter plots, or line graphs.\nThat being said, the visualizations in this book are not necessarily always the most effective choice of visualization for the data and relationship shown. Rather, this book aims to show you examples of the end-to-end process of creating data visualizations, with a focus on the technical details of building them in R. You’ll see some hacky solutions and unusual ideas that you can use to transform your data visualizations.",

Readers of this book may find a basic knowledge of R, more specifically of the {tidyverse} ecosystem, useful though all code used in examples is fully explained. Readers do not need to be experienced in {ggplot2}, though this book will also be of interest to those who are. Readers of this book will be of interest to those who are already familiar with R (including {ggplot2}), and wish to develop their skills in designing data visualizations further. It will also be of interest to those who already design data visualizations using other tools, and want to learn how to do the equivalent in R.",

    "section": "1.3 A note about R code",
    "text": "1.3 A note about R code\nAll code in this was created using R version 4.3.0, and a complete list of package versions can be found in the Appendix.\n\n1.3.1 Base R pipe vs {magrittr} pipe\nIn R, the pipe operator takes the thing on its left and passes it along to the function on its right (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund 2023). You can find a full description of the pipe operator in R for Data Science. The pipe (%&gt;%) was first introduced to R via the {magrittr} package. Since version 4.1.0 of R, a version of the pipe (|&gt;) has existed in base R. The base R version of the pipe is used throughout the book. Although there are some difference between the two version of the pipe, in this book, they can be used interchangeably.\n\n\n1.3.2 Namespacing\nNamespacing (the pre-fixing of functions with the package name and ::) is used for all packages except {ggplot2} and base R packages. Namespacing is useful for two reasons (i) from a learning perspective, it makes it easier to recognise where functions come from and how they connect together, and (ii) from a programming perspective, it reduces conflicts and errors - something we all want less of!\n\n\n1.3.3 Changes from earlier versions\nYou may notice that some of the final images differ slightly from those initially created and published on social media. You might also find some small differences in the code used to produce them if you compare the contents of this book to original scripts in the GitHub repository. These differences are likely due to one of four reasons:\n\npackages have since been updated and code has been changed to use newer syntax;\nsome aspects have been omitted from a visualization to avoid explaining everything in Chapter 1 - but those aspects are all covered and linked to in later chapters;\nafter many years of practice, there may be more efficient ways of re-writing code from some of the earlier plots. Any changes are clearly labelled and discussed;\nsome images may be different due to copyright reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023.

    "text": "4.2 Initial exploration\nAs in other chapters n this book, we’ll start with some basic exploratory plots in base R. For example, we may look at the distribution of variables in each category using the barplot function:\n\nbarplot(\n  table(technology$category),\n  las = 2,\n  cex.axis = 0.5,\n  cex.names = 0.5\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsome initial base R exploratory plots\nLet’s look at something more specific\nA list of all ISO3 country codes can be obtained by running unique(technology$iso3c), and from there we can choose a subset of countries we want to look at in more detail. Let’s look at Great Britain, USA, Sweden, Brazil, New Zealand, and Venezuela, and store these choices in a vector called countries. We also need to narrow down the data we want to consider - there are 194 different questions contained in the data. You can check by running length(unique(technology$label)). One variable we will consider further is the percentage of children who received a measles immunization - indicated by the \"pctimmunizmeas\" level in the variable column.\nAlthough including all years of data would better allow us to consider trends in the values, sometimes looking at a only a few snapshots can be more effective. For example, by considering only the years 1980 and 2010 as we’ll do here, readers get a Wow, look how much things have changed! message rather than the perhaps less impactful visual of a gradual trend. We can use the filter function from {dplyr} to filter our technology data set to consider only the rows showing data about percentage of children who received a measles immunization, in the years 1980 or 2010, and relating to countries in our specified vector of countries.\nWe no longer need the group, category, variable, or label columns, as these are constant for our data so we can remove these columns using select() from {dplyr}.\n\n# subset of countries to look at further\ncountries &lt;- c(\"GBR\", \"USA\", \"SWE\", \"BRA\", \"NZL\", \"VEN\")\n\n# subset data for specific topic, years, and countries\nmeasles_data &lt;- technology |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(\n    label == \"% children who received a measles immunization\",\n    year %in% c(1980, 2010),\n    iso3c %in% countries\n  ) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(-c(group, category, variable, label))\nhead(measles_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  iso3c  year value\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BRA    1980    57\n2 BRA    2010    99\n3 GBR    1980    53\n4 GBR    2010    89\n5 NZL    1980    80\n6 NZL    2010    91\n\n\nOur tidier data now shows just the percentage (value) of children who received a measles immunization in each country (iso3c), in each of 1980 and 2010 (year), How might we visualize this data?\nThere are a couple of obvious options that come to mind: a simple grouped bar chart, a slope chart, or indeed the (not often popular) pie chart Our choice of data visualization will depend on which aspects of the data we want to show. Do we want to compare 1980 to 2010? Do we want to compare countries to each other? Do we just want to show the range of values in the data? In this data, the most interesting example is a comparison between 1980 and 2010. Although a slope chart would likely work well for this data, we’re going a little bit more experimental with a gauge chart.\nAt the time of writing, there isn’t a built-in function in {ggplot2} to create gauge charts. If you’ve never heard of a gauge chart, this initial sketch might give you an idea of what we’re aiming for.\nphotos of sketches\nBefore …",

    "text": "4.11 Reflection\nAre gauge charts the most effective method of visualising this data? No. Gauge charts have their own problems, some of which you can see here. Since the ring representing 2010 is on the outside, the radius is larger, and therefore the area . If you measure the change on arc length between 1980 and 2010, you’ll get different answers to if you measured the proportional change in area for the two.\n\n\n\n\nComin, D., and Hohijn B. 2004. “Cross-Country Technological Adoption: Making the Theories Face the Facts.” Journal of Monetary Economics January 2004: 39–83.\n\n\nPedersen, Thomas Lin. 2022.
