    "text": "About the author\nNicola Rennie is a Lecturer in Health Data Science within the Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics at Lancaster University. She holds a PhD in Statistics and Operational Research, focusing on analysing and visualising transport demand. Her current research is focused on applications of statistics and machine learning to health-related data, communicating statistics, and the effective teaching of data science. She has experience of teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, in courses covering fundamentals of data science, population health, and statistical programming. Nicola has also previously worked in data science consultancy, and delivered training courses covering topics including advanced data visualisation with R, statistical modelling, and reproducible reporting. She is the author and maintainer of several R packages, including multiple {ggplot2} extension packages. Nicola is a regular speaker at R and data science meetups, and is the current chapter organiser of R-Ladies Lancaster. She is co-author of the Royal Statistical Society’s Best Practices for Data Visualisation Guide, and an active member of the Royal Statistical Society. Several of her data visualisations have been long-listed at the Information is Beautiful Awards."

    "text": "1.4 A note about R code\nAll code in this was created using r R.version.string, and a complete list of package versions can be found in the Appendix.\n\n1.4.1 Base R pipe vs {magrittr} pipe\nIn R, the pipe operator takes the thing on its left and passes it along to the function on its right (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund 2023). You can find a full description of the pipe operator in R for Data Science. The pipe (%&gt;%) was first introduced to R via the {magrittr} package. Since version 4.1.0 of R, a version of the pipe (|&gt;) has existed in base R. The base R version of the pipe is used throughout the book. Although there are some difference between the two version of the pipe, in this book, they can be used interchangeably.\n\n\n1.4.2 Namespacing\nNamespacing (the pre-fixing of functions with the package name and ::) is used for all packages except {ggplot2} and base R packages. Namespacing is useful for two reasons (i) from a learning perspective, it makes it easier to recognise where functions come from and how they connect together, and (ii) from a programming perspective, it reduces conflicts and errors - something we all want less of!\n\n\n1.4.3 Changes to code\nYou may notice that some of the final images differ slightly from those initially created and published on social media. You might also find some small differences in the code used to produce them if you compare the contents of this book to original scripts in the GitHub repository. These differences are primarily due to two reasons: (i) packages have been updated and code has been changed to use newer syntax; (ii) some aspects have been omitted here to avoid explaining everything in Chapter 1 - but they are all covered and linked to in later chapters!; or (iii) I found a more efficient way of doing something. Any changes are clearly labelled and discussed.\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023. R for Data Science. O-Reilly. https://r4ds.hadley.nz."
