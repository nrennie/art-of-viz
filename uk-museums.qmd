# UK Museums: highlighting line charts with {gghighlight} {#sec-museums}

In this chapter we'll consider different ways of visualising data that varies over time, aiming to avoid *spaghetti charts*, with the help of the {gghighlight} extension package\index{gghighlight}.

## Data

The [Mapping Museums](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/data) project [@museums_data] has collected data relating to over 4,000 museums in the UK, covering museums from 1960 onward. The data can be downloaded from the Mapping Museums website at [www.mappingmuseums.org](www.mappingmuseums.org). It was also used as a \#TidyTuesday\index{TidyTuesday} [@tidytuesday] data set in November 2022, and we'll use that version for this chapter.

Let's start by reading in the data and looking at the definitions of the variables: \index{readr!read\_csv}

```{r}
#| label: load-museums-data
#| output: false
museums <- readr::read_csv("data/museums.csv")
```

The data contains information for `r ncol(museums)` different variables on `r nrow(museums)` museums. After the first `museum_id` columns, the next 8 columns provide information on the location of the museum - including address and co-ordinates. The next set of columns provides information about the museums such as whether it's an accredited museum, how it's governed, what types of items it has, and when it was open. Since this is a collated data set, information is also provided on the original source of the data for some of these variables. The remaining columns provide information on the area in which the museum is located, including information about different deprivation indices and geodemogrqaphic group (type of area e.g. `"University Towns and Cities"`). A full glossary of the terms used can be found on the Mapping Museums website at [museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/glossary](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/glossary).

## Exploratory work

Let's start exploring what these variables look like!

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}

Remember that you can use `View(museums)` to inspect the data in a more human-readable format.

### Data exploration

There are many different aspects of this data we could inspect:

* How are museums spread out across the UK? Is there a higher concentration of museums in more affluent areas?
* What types of museums are most prevalent in the UK? Does the vary based on whether the museum is accredited?
* How is the number of museums open changing over time? Are more museums opening than closing?

Some of the variables, such as `DOMUS_Subject_Matter` have quite a lot of missing values which makes 

Although these definitely warrant further exploration,

Given the wealth of information around deprivation indices (8 different variables), that's the first aspect of the data that jumps out. How does the number of museums vary per index of deprivation?

```{r}
#| label: museums-barplot
barplot(
  table(museums$Area_Deprivation_index),
  cex.axis = 0.5,
  cex.names = 0.5
)
```

Here, `1` is the most deprived, and `10` is the least deprived. This is quite an interesting relationship - there have been more museums in places with a moderate level of deprivation compared to higher or lower level. This might feel a little bit counter-intuitive, we might expect there to be more museums in more affluent areas. But looking at the total number of museums in the data per index of deprivation doesn't tell us the whole story. How many of these museums were open at once? How many are still open today? 

To get a better understanding of the relationship between deprivation and the number of museums, we could look at how the number of museums changed for each index of deprivation has changed since 1960 (the earliest date in the data set). Then we might be able to tell whether more are opening or closing, and how this varies across the different levels of deprivation.

### Exploratory sketches

We have 10 deciles of deprivation, so we'll have 10 time series that we want to plot that show the number of museums over time. There are different options for plotting time series like this. We need to think about some different choices:

* What type of *geometry* will we use? Lines, points, shaded areas? Lines are the most common approach for 
* Do we plot all 10 lines on the same chart and use color to denote the different levels of deprivation?
* Or do we use faceting to split it into multiple smaller plots by deprivation index?

If we go with line charts, and faceting by deprivation index, that might look something like this: 

![](images/sketch-museums.png){#fig-museums-sketch fig-align="center" fig-cap="Initial sketch of a facetted plot showing change over time for each level of deprivation."}

We could achieve something this type of plot using `geom_line()` and `facet_wrap()` from {ggplot2} \index{ggplot2!facet\_wrap} \index{ggplot2!geom\_line}. We've talked about faceting before in both Chapter ...(1) and Chapter ...(2) but we haven't really thought much about the layouts of those facets. In Chapter ...(1), we used faceting with only 3 categories, where the layout choice is fairly obvious: either one column or one row. In Chapter ...(2), we used `facet_grid()` where the number of levels in two factor variables define the number of rows and columns. Here, we have a little bit more flexibility and we might want to think about controlling that layout. \index{ggplot2!facet\_grid}

If we leave it to the default options, {ggplot2} usually tries to coerce it into something *square-ish*. Here, it would likely give us a 3x4 grid filled with 10 plots (for the 10 levels of deprivation) and 2 blank spaces. It's not always possible, but plots without those blank spaces often look a lot cleaner and tidier. We could do either a 5x2 (or 2x5) grid, or a 10x1 (or 1x10) grid to fit our small multiple plots into a perfect rectangle. A 5x2 grid works better here since we don't want to make a very wide but very short plot.

## Preparing a plot

So let's get started on preparing the data to create this plot!

### Data wrangling

This is one of those very *real* datasets - the data wrangling is not straightforward for the data. In fact, the two columns relating to opening and closing dates are the two that will require the most attention.

First, let's drop any columns that we don't actually need using the `select()` function from {dplyr} - we only need the `Year_opened`, `Year_closed`, and `Area_Deprivation_index` columns to calculate the number of museums open each year \index{dplyr!select}. There are a few `NA` values in the `Area_Deprivation_index` column so we'll drop those rows using `drop_na()` from {tidyr} \index{tidyr!drop\_na}.

Now let's start dealing with the year columns. If you look at the values, you'll notice that they're not exactly what you'd expect in a *year* column:

```{r}
#| label: museums-year
head(museums$Year_opened, 4)
head(museums$Year_closed, 4)
```

Each entry is in fact two years, separated by a `:`. According to the Mapping Museums glossary, this is because these are actually date ranges. For some museums, it wasn't possible to establish an exact opening or closing date, and instead a date range is given based on partial information. For example, a value of `"2007:2017"` means the museum opened (or closed) sometime between 2007 and 2017.

Let's separate out these year values into four columns instead of two using the `separate()` function from {tidyr} \index{tidyr!separate}. We separate based on the `:`, and create two new columns, `opened1` and `opened2`. from the `Year_opened` column. We do the same thing for the `Year_closed` closed column. We also want to make sure that these new columns are numeric rather than character columns, so we use `mutate()` and `across()` from {dplyr} to convert them using `as.numeric()` \index{dplyr!mutate} \index{dplyr!across}. We can also convert the `Area_Deprivation_index` to a factor rather than a numeric and make sure the order is correct. 

```{r}
#| label: museums-wrangle1
museum_subset <- museums |>
  dplyr::select(
    Year_opened, Year_closed, Area_Deprivation_index
  ) |>
  tidyr::drop_na() |>
  tidyr::separate(
    Year_opened,
    into = c("opened1", "opened2"),
    sep = ":"
  ) |>
  tidyr::separate(
    Year_closed,
    into = c("closed1", "closed2"),
    sep = ":"
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      c(opened1, opened2, closed1, closed2), as.numeric
    ),
    Area_Deprivation_index = factor(Area_Deprivation_index, levels = 1:10)
  )
```

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}

You could alternatively use `separate_wider_delim()` instead of `separate()`. \index{tidyr!separate\_wider\_delim}

:::

Now we need to think about how to deal with all of these *year* columns: 

* If the date before the `:` and the date after the `:` are the same, we want to treat it as an exact year and only keep one value.
* If the dates do not match, we need to decide a way of choosing which year to use. The simplest approach is to take the midpoint of the date range. 
* If the value in the `Year_closed` column is `"9999:9999"`, this means that the museum is still open. 

Let's start with the last of these issues first. For the `closed1` and `closed2` columns, if the value is `"9999"`, we'll convert it to an `NA_real_` value and otherwise leave it as it is. We can do this using a combination of `mutate()`, `across()`, and `if_else()` from {dplyr} \index{dplyr!mutate} \index{dplyr!across} \index{dplyr!if\_else}.

The remaining two issues can be dealt with at the same time using `case_when()` from {dplyr} \index{dplyr!case\_when}. We can create a new column called `closed` which:

* if `closed1` and `closed2` are equal, takes this value;
* if `closed1` and `closed2` are not equal, takes the value in the middle (rounded so that we work only with whole year values).

The same approach is then applied to create another new column called `opened`. There are no instances in the data where one of the closing dates is `NA` but the other is not, so we don't need to worry about that. We can also tidy up the output by dropping any columns we don't need, renaming the `Area_Deprivation_index` to something a little bit shorter and easier to work with, and arranging the data by level of deprivation. \index{dplyr!rename} \index{dplyr!arrange} \index{dplyr!select} 

```{r}
#| label: museums-wrangle2
museum_data <- museum_subset |> 
  dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(
    c(closed1, closed2),
    ~ dplyr::if_else(.x == 9999, NA_real_, .x)
  )) |>
  dplyr::mutate(closed = dplyr::case_when(
    closed1 == closed2 ~ closed1,
    closed1 != closed2 ~ round((closed2 + closed1) / 2)
  )) |>
  dplyr::mutate(opened = dplyr::case_when(
    opened1 == opened2 ~ opened1,
    opened1 != opened2 ~ round((opened2 + opened1) / 2)
  )) |>
  dplyr::select(Area_Deprivation_index, opened, closed) |>
  dplyr::rename(deprivation = Area_Deprivation_index) |>
  dplyr::arrange(deprivation)
```

This gives us data that looks like this:

```{r}
#| label: museums-data-show
head(museum_data)
```

What we want to know is how many museums were open in a given year for each level of deprivation. Let's create a function that takes three inputs: a year of interest, a level of deprivation, and the `museum_data`. Inside the function, we can then `filter()` the data to only the level of deprivation we're interested in. Then we can count how many museums opened before or in the year we're interested in, and then same for the how many museums closed (remembering to deal with the `NA` values for museums that are still open). The difference between the two will be how many were open in that year. \index{dplyr!filter}

```{r}
#| label: museums-count-function
num_year <- function(year, dep, data = museum_data) {
  df <- dplyr::filter(data, deprivation == dep)
  num_open <- sum(df$opened <= year)
  num_closed <- sum(df$closed <= year, na.rm = TRUE)
  diff <- num_open - num_closed
  return(diff)
}
```

Let's test it works:

```{r}
#| label: museums-count-test
num_year(1980, 3)
```

There were `r num_year(1980, 3)` museums open in 1980. Now, we need to run this function for every combination of year (from `1960` to `2021`) and deprivation level (from `1` to `10`). There are many different ways of doing this in R, and we're going to use the {purrr} package [@purrr]. We start by creating to variables with sequences of years and levels of deprivation - this is useful for testing if the code works because we can easily change it to a smaller number of years. Then we use `expand.grid` to create a `data.frame` with all of the combinations and pass this in as the first argument to `pmap_vec` from {purrr}. The second argument to `pmap_vec` is the function we want to apply (`num_year()`) that we defined above), where the first argument of `num_year()` comes from the first column of the grid of values, and the second argument from the second column. We can then convert the output into a matrix where each column is a level of deprivation, and each row is a year. \index{purrr!pmap\_vec} 

```{r}
#| label: museums-count-1
all_years <- 1960:2021
deps <- 1:10
output <- purrr::pmap_vec(
  expand.grid(all_years, deps),
  ~ num_year(year = .x, dep = .y)
)
results <- matrix(output,
  nrow = length(all_years),
  byrow = FALSE
)
colnames(results) <- 1:10
```

Now, our data looks like this:

```{r}
#| label: museums-count-2
head(results)
```

We're almost ready to start plotting our data! We just need to convert this into a `tibble()` (or `data.frame`), add the `year` column using `mutate()`, and put the data into a long format using `pivot_longer` from {tidyr} \index{tibble!as\_tibble} \index{dplyr!mutate} \index{tidyr!pivot\_longer}. We want to end up with a 3 column data set, where the 3 columns are: `year`, `deprivation`, and `museums` (number of open museums).

```{r}
#| label: museums-count-3
plot_data <- results |>
  tibble::as_tibble() |>
  dplyr::mutate(year = all_years) |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    -year,
    names_to = "deprivation",
    values_to = "museums"
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    deprivation = factor(deprivation, levels = 1:10)
  )
```

### The first plot

One of most common approaches to visualising multiple time series, is to plot multiple lines on the same plot. Although we're already thinking about facets, it's still worth seeing what those line charts look like. It can help us to understand the overall variability of the data. We can create the initial plot using `ggplot()` to define the data and the aesthetic mapping with the `aes()` function. We have `year` on the x-axis, `museums` on the y-axis, and each line will have a different color based on `deprivation`. The actual lines are then added with `geom_line()`. \index{ggplot2!geom\_line} \index{ggplot2!aes} \index{ggplot2!ggplot} \index{line chart}

```{r}
#| label: fig-museums-basic-plot-1
#| fig-cap: "A line chart of total number of museums open per year for each level of deprivation, with the overlapping lines resembling spaghetti!"
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(
  data = plot_data,
  mapping = aes(x = year, y = museums, color = deprivation)
) +
  geom_line()
```

There are a few things that jump out immediately about this plot:

* The variability is increasing over time: in 1960 the gap between the highest and lowest values is much smaller than the gap between the highest and lowest values in 2020.
* It's difficult to tell which line belongs to which level of deprivation: some of the colors are quite similar, many of the lines intersect, and the order of the legend is generally in reverse to the order of the lines.
* It's what we might call a *spaghetti plot*: it shows the overall trend across all levels, but it's hard to tell the difference between different levels of deprivation.

Let's go back to our previous idea, and try separating out the deprivation levels into different facets. We can do this using `facet_wrap(~deprivation, nrow = 2)` , with the `nrow` argument used to create that 5x2 grid we talked about earlier. Let's also try changing `geom_line()` to `geom_area()` (and remember to change `color` to `fill` in the aesthetic mapping). \index{ggplot2!geom\_area} \index{ggplot2!facet\_wrap} \index{area chart}

```{r}
#| label: fig-museums-basic-plot-2
#| fig-cap: "An area chart of total number of museums open per year for each level of deprivation, with the each deprivation level in a different facet."
ggplot(
  data = plot_data,
  mapping = aes(x = year, y = museums, fill = deprivation)
) +
  geom_area() +
  facet_wrap(~deprivation, nrow = 2)
```

this was the initial design i started with, but hard to compare
let's go back to geom_line \index{gghighlight!gghighlight} \index{line chart}

```{r}
#| label: fig-museums-basic-plot-3
#| fig-cap: "A line chart of total number of museums open per year for each level of deprivation, with the each deprivation level in a different facet and individual lines highlighted."
#| message: false
#| source-line-numbers: "7"
ggplot(
  data = plot_data,
  mapping = aes(x = year, y = museums, color = deprivation)
) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~deprivation, nrow = 2) +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(use_direct_label = FALSE)
```

some of them started higher lower levels, let's look at perc change instead

```{r}
#| label: museums-wrangle-perc
lookup <- plot_data |>
  dplyr::filter(year == 1960) |>
  dplyr::select(deprivation, museums)

new_plot_data <- plot_data |>
  dplyr::left_join(lookup, by = "deprivation") |>
  dplyr::rename(
    museums = museums.x,
    museums_1960 = museums.y
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    change = (100 * (museums - museums_1960) / museums_1960)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(year, deprivation, change)
```

let's plot instead

```{r}
#| label: fig-museums-basic-plot-4
#| fig-cap: "A line chart of percentage increase in museums (compared to 1960) for each level of deprivation, with the each deprivation level in a different facet and individual lines highlighted."
#| message: false
base_plot <- ggplot(
  data = new_plot_data,
  mapping = aes(x = year, y = change, color = deprivation)
) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~deprivation, nrow = 2) +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(use_direct_label = FALSE)
base_plot
```

## Advanced styling

get rid of legend
colors aren't great

### Colors

{viridis} [@viridis] \index{viridis!scale\_color\_viridis}


```{r}
#| label: museums-colors
bg_col <- "#fafafa"
text_col <- "black"
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-museums-style-plot-1
#| fig-cap: "An updated version of the previous chart with colors chosen from the {viridis} R package."
col_plot <- base_plot +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, direction = -1)
col_plot
```

### Text and fonts

```{r}
#| label: museums-fonts
sysfonts::font_add_google("Raleway", "raleway")
showtext::showtext_auto()
showtext::showtext_opts(dpi = 300)
body_font <- "raleway"
```

{sysfonts}\index{sysfonts}
{showtext}\index{showtext}

\index{sysfonts!font\_add\_google}
\index{showtext!showtext\_auto}
\index{showtext!showtext\_opts}

Text 

make sure text is correct one

```{r}
#| label: museums-text
title <- "Are there fewer museums opening in more deprived areas?"
st <- "The change in the estimated number of open museums since 1960 is significantly lower in areas with higher levels of deprivation. *Since around 2000, the number of open museums has stagnated across all areas, regardless of deprivation index. However, the rate of growth prior to this stagnation is lower in more deprived areas."
cap <- "*The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) measures the relative deprivation of geographic areas in the UK, aggregating different dimensions (income, employment, education, health, crime, housing, and living environment). The index ranges from 1 (most deprived) to 10 (least deprived).<br><br>**In some instances it has been impossible to establish an exact opening or closing date for a museum.

```

\index{ggtext!element\_textbox\_simple}

```{r}
#| label: museums-style-plot-2
text_plot <- col_plot +
  labs(
    title = title, subtitle = st, caption = cap,
    x = "",
    y = "% change in estimated number of\nopen museums since 1960**"

### Adjusting themes

```{r}

    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption.position = "plot",
    panel.spacing = unit(1, "lines"),
    plot.margin = margin(10, 15, 10, 10),
    plot.background = element_rect(
      fill = bg_col, color = bg_col
    ),
    panel.background = element_rect(
      fill = bg_col, color = bg_col
    ),
    plot.title = element_textbox_simple(
      color = text_col,
      lineheight = 0.5,
      size = rel(1.2),
      face = "bold",
      margin = margin(b = 5)
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(
      color = text_col,
      lineheight = 0.5
    ),
    plot.caption = element_textbox_simple(
      hjust = 0,
      color = text_col,
      lineheight = 0.5
    ),
    axis.text = element_text(
      color = text_col,
      lineheight = 0.5
    )
  )
```

## Reflection

What would I want to change about this plot?

- colors not good (is it continuous)
- color probably not needed
